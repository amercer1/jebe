WHEN
LEBRONS
ON
THE
BENCH
I
FEEL
LIKE
IM
WATCHING
THE
WARRIORS
VS
WHATEVER
TEAM
PLAYS
AGAINST
THE
GLOBETROTTERS
I
WOULD
LIKE
YOU
TO
RESPECT
MY
TEAM
TYVM
THE
GENERALS
IGUODALA
SCORES
A
SEASON
HIGH
AGAINST
LEBRON
JAMES
AND
THE
CAVS
FEELS
LIKE
2007
THIS
GAME
REALLY
REMINDED
ME
OF
THE
2007
FINALS
I
JUST
SAW
ONE
TEAM
THAT
WAS
MUCH
MORE
TALENTED
THAN
THE
OTHER
AND
KNEW
EXACTLY
HOW
THEY
WANTED
TO
EXECUTE
SEEING
GUYS
LIKE
DELLY
THROWING
UP
DESPERATE
SHOTS
AND
JR
AND
SHUMP
BRICK
SHOT
AFTER
SHOT
GAVE
ME
FLASHBACKS
OF
BOOBIE
GIBSON
AND
LARRY
HUGHES
THE
CAVALIERS
DIDNT
LOSE
BY
DOUBLE
DIGITS
IN
ANY
OF
THE
FOUR
GAMES
IN
THE
2007
FINALS
THEY
ALSO
ONLY
LOST
GAME
3
BY
3
POINTS
AND
GAME
4
BY
1
POINT
YES
THEY
GOT
SWEEPED
BUT
THEY
DIDNT
GET
BEAT
DOWN
LIKE
PEOPLE
SAY
THEY
DID
THIS
FINALS
IS
REMINDING
ME
MORE
OF
A
SERIES
FROM
2006
THE
FIRST
ROUND
MATCHUP
BETWEEN
THE
SUNS
AND
THE
LAKERS
IN
THAT
SERIES
THE
SUNS
CAME
IN
AS
HEAVY
FAVORITES
AS
THE
2
SEED
AND
WITH
BY
FAR
THE
LEAGUES
BEST
OFFENSE
WHILE
THE
LAKERS
DIDNT
HAVE
MUCH
BEYOND
ONE
AMAZING
PLAYER
HOWEVER
THE
LAKERS
WERE
ABLE
TO
SHOCK
JUST
ABOUT
EVERYONE
BY
WINNING
3
OF
THE
FIRST
FOUR
GAMES
BASICALLY
USING
A
GIMMICK
IN
THAT
THEY
EFFECTIVELY
SLOWED
THE
GAMES
WAY
DOWN
AND
PLAYED
A
VERY
POSTHEAVY
OFFENSIVE
GAME
THIS
WAS
A
GIMMICK
BECAUSE
RATHER
THAN
DEFER
TO
KOBE
TO
DO
MOST
OF
THE
SCORING
THEY
INSTEAD
POUNDED
IT
INTO
KWAME
BROWN
OF
ALL
PEOPLE
IN
FACT
AFTER
LEADING
THE
LEAGUE
IN
SCORING
THAT
YEAR
WITH
OVER
35
PPG
KOBE
ONLY
SCORED
22
29
17
AND
24
RESPECTIVELY
IN
THOSE
FIRST
FOUR
GAMES
MEANWHILE
THE
SUNS
WHO
HAD
AVERAGED
MORE
THAN
108
PPG
DURING
THE
SEASON
ONLY
MANAGED
107
93
92
AND
98
POINTS
RESPECTIVELY
IN
THOSE
FOUR
GAMES
AND
GAME
4
WENT
TO
OT
BUT
EVENTUALLY
DANTONIS
COACHING
STAFF
WAS
ABLE
TO
FIGURE
OUT
HOW
TO
OVERCOME
THE
GIMMICKY
LAKERS
AND
OVER
GAMES
5
6
AND
7
THE
SUNS
WERE
ABLE
TO
PLAY
THEIR
BRAND
OF
BASKETBALL
AND
BLEW
THE
LAKERS
OFF
THE
COURT
WITH
MAYBE
THE
ONE
EXCEPTION
BEING
WHEN
KOBE
SCORED
HIS
PLAYOFF
CAREER
HIGH
OF
50
IN
GAME
6
BUT
THE
PHOENIX
POINT
TOTALS
IN
THOSE
3
GAMES
SPEAK
FOR
THEMSELVES
114
126
AND
121
RESPECTIVELY
USUALLY
A
GIMMICK
CAN
ONLY
GET
YOU
SO
FAR
BUT
ALMOST
ALWAYS
IN
THE
NBA
PLAYOFFS
THE
BETTER
TEAM
WINS
THE
SERIES
DUDE
IS
MVP
IF
WARRIORS
WIN
IT
ALL
I
WOULD
BE
SO
HAPPY
TO
SEE
IGGY
GET
THE
FINALS
MVP
HES
SO
UNDERAPPRECIATED
AND
HAS
BEEN
SUCH
A
COMPLETE
PLAYER
FOR
SO
LONG
A
LOT
OF
SIXER
FANS
MYSELF
INCLUDED
WOULD
BE
ESTATIC
TO
SEE
THAT
I
REMEMBER
WHEN
WE
PLAYED
CHICAGO
IN
THE
FIRST
ROUND
THE
YEAR
ROSE
WENT
DOWN
BE
BASICALLY
WILLED
US
INTO
THE
SECOND
ROUND
YOU
COULD
SEE
HOW
BAD
HE
WANTED
IT
IN
HIS
WHOLE
CAREER
THIS
IS
ONLY
HIS
SECOND
TIME
OUT
OF
THE
FIRST
ROUND
SO
HAPPY
FOR
HIM
I
KNOW
LEBRON
IS
A
GOD
BUT
TONIGHT
IGGY
JUST
OUTPLAYED
HIM
IN
ALMOST
EVERY
ASPECT
TODAY
IM
ROOTING
FOR
THE
CAVS
TO
WIN
THE
WHOLE
THING
BUT
TONIGHT
THEY
JUST
GOT
DONE
DELETED
THEY
REALLY
WERE
THOUGH
THERE
WAS
A
REBOUND
WHERE
IGGY
WAS
GRABBING
HIS

BUT
HE
STRAIGHT
UP
STIFF
ARMED
HIM
IN
THE

AND
STILL
DREW
THE
FOUL

SERIOUSLY
HOW

DOES

HAVE
ON

HOW
ELSE
DO
YOU
EXPECT
HIM
TO
PAY
FOR

IT
WAS
SO
QUIET
IN
THE
4TH
YOU
COULD
HEAR
ALL
THE
HEAT
FANS
LEAVING
IT
ALWAYS
MAKES
ME
ANGRY
WHEN
PEOPLE
LEAVE
A
GAME
LIKE
THAT
ESPECIALLY
CLEVELAND
A
SPORTS
CITY
WHO
HASNT
SEEN
MUCH
SUCCESS
AT
ALL
LIKE
THIS
IS
THE
CAVS
BEST
CHANCE
AT
A
CHAMPIONSHIP
EVER
AND
THEYRE
LEAVING
AT
THIS
POINT
IM
MORE
UPSET
BY
THE
CROWD
THAN
THE
TEAM
DOWN
BASICALLY
THE
ENTIRE
GAME
AND
YOURE
SITTING
IN
SILENCE
GET
PUMPED
UP
AND
GET
BEHIND
THE

THE

20
SECONDS

WAS
OFF
AND
THE

WERE
OBVIOUSLY
TRYING
TO
MAKE
THE
STOP
EVERYONE
IN
THE

STOOD
UP
AND
THAT
WAS
IT
IT
WAS
JUST
A
BUNCH
OF

THEY
WERE
GETTING
READY
TO
GO

ME
TOO

FANS
ARE
WEIRD
EVEN
WHEN
THE

WERENT
DOWN
BY
THAT
MUCH
THEY
STAYED
QUIET
RATHER
THAN
JUST
CHEERING
ON
THE
TEAM
AND
TRYING
TO
HELP
THEM
RALLY
BUT
LEBRON
SAID
IT
IN
THAT
COMMERCIAL
THAT
THE

ARE
GREAT
AND

WILL
CHEER
AT
A

EVEN
IF
THEIR

IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
DOWN
WITH
2
MINUTES

I
KNOW
US
CLEVELANDERS
ARE
CONDITIONED
TO
LOSE
BUT
FUCK
WARRIORS
CHANTS
AT
THE
Q
THATS
PATHETIC
FANS
HAVE
A

I
KINDA
FELT
BAD
FOR
YOU

AT
THAT

KIND
OF
IM
PISSED
BECAUSE
THE
SAME
PEOPLE

THEY
WOULDNT
DO
THAT
TO

REGRETS
IT

WERE
REALLY
TRYING

HARRIS
INTO

EVERY
SECOND
LEBRON
DOESNT
PLAY
JUST
SHOWS
THAT
WHAT
HE
DID
IN
THE
FIRST
3
GAMES
WAS
ABSOLUTELY
INSANE
THEY
DONT
HAVE
ANYONE
ELSE
ON
THE

WHO
CAN
DRIBBLE
HERES
AN
OVERREACTION
ON
HOW
FUCKED
THE

IT
CHECKS

I

IS
GOING
TO
GIVE
A

TO

THIS
GAME
AND
RIGHTFULLY
SO
BUT
I
HOPE
LIVINGSTON
GETS
SOME
SHINE
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
A
GREAT
GAME
IN
MY
OPINION
BIGGEST
SEQUENCE
OF
THE
GAME
WAS
THE
VERY
END
OF
THE
3RD
AND
1ST
2
MINUTES
OF
THE

PUSHED
TO

I
KNOW
LEBRON
IS
GASSED
AND
NO
ONE
CAN
HOLD
THAT
AGAINST
HIM

BUT
HE
HONESTLY
CANT
AFFORD
TO
REST
THIS
SERIES
WHEN
HES
NOT
ON
THE
FLOOR
ITS
HARD
TO
IMAGINE
THE
CAVS
SCORING
AT
ALL
SOMEONE
NEEDS
TO
STEP
UP
AND
CREATE
THEIR
OWN
SHOT
OR
A
SHOT
FOR

NO

HAS
SHOWN
THEY
CAN
DO

COME
ALL
THE

BACK
LOOK
AT
THAT
ROSTER
IF
YOU
TAKE
AWAY
LEBRON
ITS
HORRIFYING
TO
ME
THE
BIGGEST
THING
THAT
I
SAW
WAS
THE
TRAPPING
OF
LEBRON
THAT
SET
OFF
SOOOO
MANY
GOOD
THINGS
FOR
THIS
GAME
IDK
IF
THEY
WILL
CONTINUE
FOR
G5
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
SERIES
BUT
JUST
THINK
ABOUT
ALL
OF
THIS
FIRST
THEY
ARENT
LETTING
HIM
DRIBBLE
UP
IGGY
IS
PICKING
HIM
UP
MUCH
EARLIER
IN
THE
COURT
AND
NOW
THEY
ARE
ALSO
TRAPPING
HIM
TRAPPING
LEBRON
IN
THE
HIGH
POST
1618
FT
LEAVES
SOMEONE
OPEN
USUALLY
DELLY
LEBRONS
PG
MENTALITY
TELLS
HIM
TO
PASS
PLUS
HE
ONLY
ATTACKS
DOUBLE
TEAMS
WHEN
LEBRON
GOES
INTO
ULTRALEBRON
USUALLY
IN
ELIMINATION
GAMES
SO
LEBRON
PASSES
IT
EARLY
IN
THE
SHOT
CLOCK
THEN
GSW
DOES
A
GREAT
JOB
OF
ROTATING
SIMILAR
TO
THE
SPURS
CAVS
ROLE
PLAYERS
EITHER
TAKE
THE
SHOT
OR
PUMP
AND
DRIVE
EITHER
WAY
GSW
HAS
WON
THAT
POSSESSION
BALL
IS
OUT
OF
LEBRONS
HAND
AND
NO
LONGER
ARE
THE
ROLE
PLAYERS
STANDING
ON
THE
3
LINE
NOW
EVEN
IF
THEY
MAKE
THE
DRIVE
THERE
ARE
LESS
PLAYERS
GETTING
BACK
ON
D
FOR
CLEVELAND
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
LESS
ISO
PLAY
SO
THAT
ALLOWS
GSW
TO
KICK
UP
THE
PACE
AND
ATTACK
NOT
LETTING
LEBRON
DICTATE
THE
PACE
SOMETHING
EVERYONE
IS
EMPHASIZING
OBVIOUSLY
THERE
ARE
OTHER
FACTORS
TO
THIS
WIN
FOR
GSW
CAVS
WERE
TIRED
AND
DIDNT
MAKE
SHOTS
GREEN
IGGY
BARNES
MADE
THEIR
SHOTS
WHILE
JR
SHUMPS
DELLY
DIDNT
BUT
TO
ME
THE
BIGGEST
STATS
ARE
MOZGOV
GOING
FOR
28
WHILE
LEBRON
WENT
FOR
20
ON
22
SHOTS
GSW
USED
THEIR
SMALL
LINEUP
GIVING
MOZGOV
FREE
REIGN
ON
GREEN
LEBRON
WILL
FEED
THAT
MISMATCH
AGAIN
PG
MENTALITY
FORCING
HIM
TO
SEE
THAT
MISMATCH
LEBRON
MUST
GET
UP
THOSE
40
SHOTS
HE
HAS
BEEN
GETTING
UP
BECAUSE
OTHERWISE
HE
HAS
TO
SHOOT
EFFICIENTLY
AND
HE
SIMPLY
CANT
DO
THAT
WITH
THE
PHYSICAL
PLAY
THAT
GSW
IS
PLAYING
PLUS
THE
AMAZING
D
IGGY
IS
PLAYING
ON
HIM
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
WE
LOVE
AND
HATE
ABOUT
LEBRON
IT
IS
Y
HE
IS
SO
DIFFERENT
AS
A
STAR
HE
WILL
NOT
ALWAYS
PLAY
WITH
THE
KILLER
INSTINCT
HE
NEEDS
BUT
WHEN
HE
DOES
HE
CANT
BE
STOPPED
THIS
REALLY
SETS
UP
FOR
A
GREAT
G5
I
LIED
STEVE
FUCKING
KERR
SHOUT
OUT
TO
JOEY
FOR
THE
BEST
DAMN
OFFICIATED
GAME
SINCE
GAME
1
LEBRONS
GOAL
CAME
TRUE
JOE
HARRIS
GOT
IN
THE
GAME
LEBRON
0
POINTS
IN
THE
4TH
QUARTER
LEBRONS
D
JUST
WASNT
ENOUGH
TONIGHT
LOOKED
LIKE
ENOUGH
TO
ME
PROPS
TO
MOZGOD
THOUGHPRETTY
MUCH
THE
ONLY
CAV
WHO
DIDNT
SHOOT
TERRIBLY
CRAZY
LEBRON
WAS
20
PTS
AWAY
FROM
40
AND
THE
CAVS
WERE
21
POINTS
AWAY
FROM
WINNING
IT
REALLY
WASNT
AN
OVERREACTION
TO
SAY
THAT
THEY
NEED
40PT
GAMES
FROM
HIM
EVEN
MORE
AMAZING
THAT
HES
BEEN
GIVING
IT
TO
THEM
THUS
FAR
MOZGOV
HAD
A
CAREER
HIGH
28
POINTS
TONIGHT
THOUGH
KIND
OF
NEED
TO
TAKE
THAT
INTO
CONSIDERATION
TOO

TELL

MORE
ABOUT
HOW
DRAYMOND

IS
LITERALLY
USELESS
MORE
ABOUT
HOW

IS
UNQUESTIONABLY
THE
GOAT
MORE
ABOUT
HOW
DELLY
OWNS
CURRY
SERIOUSLY
I
KNOW
ITS
ALMOST
CLICHE
TO
RIDE
THIS
SUB
FOR
BEING
COMPLETELY
REACTIONARY
BUT
TODAY
WAS
SATISFYING
FOR
ME
AFTER
WEEKS
OF
HEARING
PEOPLE
TALK
SHIT
WEEKS
IS
BIT
TOO
MUCH
CONTINUITY
FOR
THE
SUB
TO
KEEP
AN
OPINION
ITS
ONLY
BEEN
SINCE

BUT
I
SEE
YOUR
POINT
THIS
IS
THE
FLUKE
GAME
IF

WINS
THE

ONE
THATS
WHEN
WE
FLIP
RIGHT
NOW
WE
HEAR
FOR

THAT
IT
WAS
HIS

IN

GUESS
WE
WILL
ALL
BE
LISTENING
TO

FOR
GAME

BECAUSE

JR
SMITH
HAS
TRULY
BEEN
THE
MOST
DISAPPOINTING
PLAYER
OF
THESE
FINALS
AND
ITS
NOT
EVEN
CLOSE
212
AND

WITH

WHO
ARE
BASICALLY
JUST

WHAT
DID

EXPECT
FROM

THE
IDEA
THAT
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
A
TERRIBLE

OR
EVEN
A

FROM
JR

IS
JUST
DUMB
I

BASICALLY
WHAT

PEOPLE
EXPECTED

FINALS
ESPECIALLY
AFTER
KYRIE
WENT
DOWN
HE
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
PROVIDE
SOME
OFFENSIVE
SPARK
HE
SIMPLY
HAS
NOT
DONE

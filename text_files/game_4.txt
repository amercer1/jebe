when lebrons on the bench i feel like im watching the warriors vs whatever team plays against the globetrotters i would like you to respect my team tyvm the generals iguodala scores a season high against lebron james and the cavs feels like 2007 this game really reminded me of the 2007 finals i just saw one team that was much more talented than the other and knew exactly how they wanted to execute seeing guys like delly throwing up desperate shots and jr and shump brick shot after shot gave me flashbacks of boobie gibson and larry hughes the cavaliers didnt lose by double digits in any of the four games in the 2007 finals they also only lost game 3 by 3 points and game 4 by 1 point yes they got sweeped but they didnt get beat down like people say they did this finals is reminding me more of a series from 2006 the first round matchup between the suns and the lakers in that series the suns came in as heavy favorites as the 2 seed and with by far the leagues best offense while the lakers didnt have much beyond one amazing player however the lakers were able to shock just about everyone by winning 3 of the first four games basically using a gimmick in that they effectively slowed the games way down and played a very postheavy offensive game this was a gimmick because rather than defer to kobe to do most of the scoring they instead pounded it into kwame brown of all people in fact after leading the league in scoring that year with over 35 ppg kobe only scored 22 29 17 and 24 respectively in those first four games meanwhile the suns who had averaged more than 108 ppg during the season only managed 107 93 92 and 98 points respectively in those four games and game 4 went to ot but eventually dantonis coaching staff was able to figure out how to overcome the gimmicky lakers and over games 5 6 and 7 the suns were able to play their brand of basketball and blew the lakers off the court with maybe the one exception being when kobe scored his playoff career high of 50 in game 6 but the phoenix point totals in those 3 games speak for themselves 114 126 and 121 respectively usually a gimmick can only get you so far but almost always in the nba playoffs the better team wins the series dude is mvp if warriors win it all i would be so happy to see iggy get the finals mvp hes so underappreciated and has been such a complete player for so long a lot of sixer fans myself included would be estatic to see that i remember when we played chicago in the first round the year rose went down be basically willed us into the second round you could see how bad he wanted it in his whole career this is only his second time out of the first round so happy for him i know lebron is a god but tonight iggy just outplayed him in almost every aspect today im rooting for the cavs to win the whole thing but tonight they just got done deleted they really were though there was a rebound where iggy was grabbing his jersey but he straight up stiff armed him in the face and still drew the foul edit my fault it was livingston still got stiff armed wasnt that livingston lebron gets away with murder getting a steal on lebron is a foul as well pretty much iggy had a clean strip on him and they called it a foul so did green yep those calls were pretty ridiculous but joey crawford has refed 50 finals games 50 he is infallible clevelands rotation perimeter players tonight  lebron james 722  matthew dellavedova 314  jr smith 212  iman shumpert 29  james jones 03 whether its fatigue golden states defensive adjustments or simply missing makeable shots its pretty damn tough to be competitive with those kinds of numbers knicks squad went throwback thursday i got real nostalgic seeing jr and shump missing all those shots felt like home watching the cavs offense in the beginning of the 4th without lebron was like a flashback httpiimgurcomhb7hwunjpg knickstape you can take them out of the knicks but you cant take the knicks out of them jr with that  of 28 he was a tomato can for us this game oh excuse me i meant 27 much better gtmatthew dellavedova 314 hopefully we can end the delly circlejerk book of delly 314 thou shall give false hope once in a while although one bad night should not warrant a kneejerk judgement the hype for delly these past few days was ridiculous borderline childish its a combination of all but when youre star player is 30 years old putting in 40 mins per game on a 7man rotation all you have to do is wait it out unfortunately i think this is not an anomaly and the rest of the series will be like this the cavs and lebron are so spent i really enjoyed the first 3 games and i hope im wrong this was just sad to watch mixture of both im sure narrative shifts incoming overreactions inc ill have some knee jerky please boy did lebron have an awful day lost the game everyone saw your yahoo smashed your head into a camera exhaustion not sure which one of these is the worst got good morning america going for him tomorrow though my mom loves that show talk to guillermo maybe you couldve won iman let him straighten your hair can i fatbooth your face wait when did we see his yahoo httpsmyoutubecomwatchv_bqoujzcmy4 why am i watching this bet you replayed it too you cant prove shit backs away wow why did the guy sound so excited when it was about to happen ooaah ooaah ooaah its not everyday you get to see royal jewels httpiimgurcomrg0bs1ugif httpiimgurcomttc9ckqgif huh i have one of those maybe were not so different yeah video was removed mirror got outplayed by iggy and mozgov maybe even curry what everyone really cared about the game tonight the cavs halftime food spreadhttpiimgurcomonj85bljpg reading that i was half expecting a pic of lepenis again to each their own i guess youre not winning any game shooting 427 from the three point of line so many open shots too delly and jr were taking bad shots too from deep they def looked tired delly was taking shots he wouldnt have taken before the hype want to his head nice to see a glimpse of prime andre iguadala livingston was phenomenal too i really really want him to win a ring after all hes been through for real his injury was fucking brutal amazing comeback by him jr and shump playing like the knicks i know remember when people were seriously asking why we traded them away i love those guys but you cant rebuild team around them timofey mozgov after the game they didnt let me have 28 i got 28 then later he was seen saying if he dies he dies damn iggys first start this year and he beasted it hes been our best most consistent player this series and hes been killing it hes started every game hes been in before this season and hes been doing great in any role hes been in jr smith with the classic jr smith game tonight jr jr smith smith cameras affected both of lebrons heads tonight     seriously how much fuckin money does jr have on the warriors how else do you expect him to pay for his segway it was so quiet in the 4th you could hear all the heat fans leaving it always makes me angry when people leave a game like that especially cleveland a sports city who hasnt seen much success at all like this is the cavs best chance at a championship ever and theyre leaving at this point im more upset by the crowd than the team down basically the entire game and youre sitting in silence get pumped up and get behind the team instill some confidence do something this isnt the opera its the nba finals ridiculous the weirdest fucking thing 3rd quarter the warriors had the ball with like 20 seconds left shot clock was off and the cavs were obviously trying to make the stop everyone in the stadium stood up and that was it it was just a bunch of standing quiet people they were getting ready to go home me too cavs fans are weird even when the cavs werent down by that much they stayed quiet rather than just cheering on the team and trying to help them rally but lebron said it in that commercial that the cleveland fans are great and wonderful half these dudes burned lebrons jersey in 2010 lebron face urinal cakes its true i think its so funny honestly i hate when the cleveland fans just give up gsw fans will cheer at a made free throw even if their team is significantly down with 2 minutes left i know us clevelanders are conditioned to lose but fuck warriors chants at the q thats pathetic fans have a fucking obligation too that was bad handful of warriors fans beat an entire stadium of cav fans you dont even know how happy that made me feel when i heard that but yeah i kinda felt bad for you guys at that point kind of im pissed because the same people said they wouldnt do that to their team when our fake fans left id take lebron scoring less than mozgov any day that was unexpected as fuck mozgov is the leading scorer and is getting pt in the fourth should be expected when gs plays small nobody to defend him down low gettin iggy wit it his voice is so much higher than i expected yeah i was shocked when i heard him speak sounds pretty normal here just think he was fatigued httpyoutubelbpqgqcl0pg genius move to put him in the starting unit theres a reason hes been a starter for so long gthes been a starter for so long thats why i respect him so much he knows that on any other team he can start but he accepted his role no questions asked winning helps he said jokingly in a post game interview once that hed be pissed at steve kerr if he was going to come off the bench and theyd lose more i love iggy he seems like such a genuinely good guy even before he tried to shake jones hand after the block first things first hes the realest iggy turned back the clock on both ends what a game by iggy first she gets engaged to swaggy p then she dominates in the finals what a woman explains why she cancelled her tour had to start for gsw she wants to get a championship before swaggy p does jr with a 27 hahahahaha before the game  desperation move by kerr with the lineup change 2 minutes into the game  what a stupid move by kerr end of the game  genius move by kerr some of you guys are so reactionary hahaha hahaha cant even be surprised by the overreactions anymore seriously fucking ridiculous the gsw hate was insane after game 3 even though they had outscored the cavs 192191 through three games basketball has so many variables that you cant reduce it down to the warriors suck or the cavs suck the lebron undisputed goat were the ones when i stopped even caring rnba at its finest i wouldnt be surprised if someone had tattoed delly on his arm right after game 2 that probably regrets it right now jr better be saving up a 40 point game for the past 4 games hes had looks like the cavs were really trying to get joe harris into the game every second lebron doesnt play just shows that what he did in the first 3 games was absolutely insane they dont have anyone else on the team who can dribble heres an overreaction on how fucked the cavs are bucks in six its an older joke but it checks out deleted cleveland looked gassed with all the talk about jr not making anything im surprised theres nothing about dellys atrocious game 314 shooting one circus layup two threes and eleven bricks and a partridge in a pear tree  lebron is 06 in the finals without wade in the building lebron cant win a finals game when wade is not in the building lol i know everyone is going to give a lot of credit to iggy this game and rightfully so but i hope livingston gets some shine because he had a great game in my opinion biggest sequence of the game was the very end of the 3rd and 1st 2 minutes of the 4th cavs down 3 steph hits a 3 pushes to 6 then lebron sits to start 4th lead pushed to 10 i know lebron is gassed and no one can hold that against him  but he honestly cant afford to rest this series when hes not on the floor its hard to imagine the cavs scoring at all someone needs to step up and create their own shot or a shot for someone else and no one has shown they can do that lebron sitting killed any momentum cleveland built up in the third they were just lost offensively gtlebron sitting killed any momentum cleveland built up in the third exact same thing happened last game cavs went on that run and took a big lead by the end of the 3rd lebron sits to start the 4th and the warriors come all the way back look at that roster if you take away lebron its horrifying to me the biggest thing that i saw was the trapping of lebron that set off soooo many good things for this game idk if they will continue for g5 and the rest of the series but just think about all of this first they arent letting him dribble up iggy is picking him up much earlier in the court and now they are also trapping him trapping lebron in the high post 1618 ft leaves someone open usually delly lebrons pg mentality tells him to pass plus he only attacks double teams when lebron goes into ultralebron usually in elimination games so lebron passes it early in the shot clock then gsw does a great job of rotating similar to the spurs cavs role players either take the shot or pump and drive either way gsw has won that possession ball is out of lebrons hand and no longer are the role players standing on the 3 line now even if they make the drive there are less players getting back on d for cleveland because there is less iso play so that allows gsw to kick up the pace and attack not letting lebron dictate the pace something everyone is emphasizing obviously there are other factors to this win for gsw cavs were tired and didnt make shots green iggy barnes made their shots while jr shumps delly didnt but to me the biggest stats are mozgov going for 28 while lebron went for 20 on 22 shots gsw used their small lineup giving mozgov free reign on green lebron will feed that mismatch again pg mentality forcing him to see that mismatch lebron must get up those 40 shots he has been getting up because otherwise he has to shoot efficiently and he simply cant do that with the physical play that gsw is playing plus the amazing d iggy is playing on him this is something we love and hate about lebron it is y he is so different as a star he will not always play with the killer instinct he needs but when he does he cant be stopped this really sets up for a great g5 i lied steve fucking kerr shout out to joey for the best damn officiated game since game 1 lebrons goal came true joe harris got in the game lebron 0 points in the 4th quarter lebrons d just wasnt enough tonight looked like enough to me props to mozgod thoughpretty much the only cav who didnt shoot terribly crazy lebron was 20 pts away from 40 and the cavs were 21 points away from winning it really wasnt an overreaction to say that they need 40pt games from him even more amazing that hes been giving it to them thus far mozgov had a career high 28 points tonight though kind of need to take that into consideration too shaun livingston 25 so where will the circlejerk go today iggy its so iggy cant wait to see rnbas complete 180 tell me more about how draymond green is literally useless more about how lebron is unquestionably the goat more about how delly owns curry seriously i know its almost cliche to ride this sub for being completely reactionary but today was satisfying for me after weeks of hearing people talk shit weeks is bit too much continuity for the sub to keep an opinion its only been since game 2 but i see your point this is the fluke game if gsw wins the next one thats when we flip right now we hear for the next couple of days how jr wont have a bad game again iggy wont shoot that well again and delly just needs more coffee i saw lebrons crown jewels on live tv httpimgurcomstf1kna thefappening im surprised there wasnt a little sweatband around the head of it so relevant lolhttpiimgurcomi1ok6qngifv what a time to be alive ironically steve kerr only played 7 guys tonight didnt really use the depth but still outplayed the cavs anyone else see how quickly the crowd started leaving steve kerr made the right adjustment by starting iguodala and outcoached blatt iggy was great but the most important thing is that bogut barely played he just cant keep up with moz or tt hes a fantastic player and a defensive anchor but he doesnt fit in right now playing small and playing dlee has been an amazing move most importantly dlee is producing if d lee had finished another 34 shots which he really could have seeing the talent he has this game would have been over much earlier jacksonjvg were talking about it all past few games bogut not even getting back over half court making it a 4v5 for the longest time when theyre trying to run an offensive set amazing job by the first year coach means a lot coming from the amazing spiderman anyone saw livingston getting pushed by lebron while he was in the air how the fuk was that not a flagrant lol also anyone got the vid of it the mods took the vid thread down seconds after it went up i was alive when iggy was playing in the nba theyre naming an arena in the us after him the iggloo i was alive when rnba gargled dellavedovas jizz for four days at the beginning of the game kerr said in a timeout dont worry they have short rotations you will outlast them just stay patient saw people in the game thread saying how silly it was to rely on that for strategy kerr knew exactly what he was doing and its clear that it was his strategy from the jump great coaching adjustments and he flat out destroyed blatt in strategy guess we will all be listening to radio broadcasts for game 5 because cameras are now banned jr smith has truly been the most disappointing player of these finals and its not even close 212 and 08 from deep with the absurd 29  edit to all of the dipshits who are basically just like hurr durr what did u expect from jr the idea that you would expect a terrible game or even a bad game from jr smith is just dumb i dont like this player so i expect him to have a bad game is basically what this amounts to jr smith had a pretty great series against atlanta and if anything people expected him to be decent in the finals especially after kyrie went down he was supposed to provide some offensive spark he simply has not done so if you dont understand the difference between jrs role on the knicks and jrs role on the cavs you probably havent been paying attention philhttpcdn0voxcdncomassets4588709illuminatigif sends his regards jr smith had a game scorehttpwwwnbastuffercomcomponentoptioncom_glossaryitemid0catid42funcviewtermgame20score of 34 which would put him among the 30 worst nba finals performances i felt a great disturbance in the arena as if thousands of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced i fear something terrible has happened there was a sequence when it was was something like 7870 and it looked like the cavs got momentum back jr proceeded to miss a layup miss a 3 and then miss another 3 on the offensive rebound its lebron and mozgov vs the world right now ive been calling for a jr smith game this whole series pretty sure ive been jinxing him jr gonna be shit next game023 with 11 turnovers calling it now thats the jr smith i remember that offensive series when mozgov kept battling for rebounds and jr just kept continuously taking shitty threes also dellavadova thought he was really good and could do it on his own way too many times delly must have been on rnba the past few days gtiman shumpert 29 fg 12  gtjr smith 212 fg 27  httpimgurcomi5gwdxo this was the warriors team that i expected to show up all series the cavs are 01 when jr smith shows up on a segway in seriousness the warriors needed people to show up curry iggy and livingston definitely showed up this game cant wait for the rest of the series those warriors chants at the q must be so fucking demoralizing a buddy just texted me and said the warriors starters were on the bench egging the warriors fans to get loud that finger shush by klay is the greatest deleted mj would be fully erect for finals games dellevadova needs to show his and the circlejerk will be complete lebron and the cavs look tired warriors smell blood and finally hit their groove on their way back to oakland im going to outback steakhouse httpwwwredditcomrnbacomments39iqargame_thread_golden_state_warriors_12_clevelandcs3oyc1 ill post proof next game thread the reffing always gets brought up when it sucks so this is only fair that game was reffed very well eh people also only talk about it in close games tough to blame 21 points on the refs warriors have a terrible shooting game  lose by 2 cavs have a bad shooting game  lose by 21 i seriously think that if the warriors win the finals and steph doesnt go for like 40 each game that iggy deserves the mvp its his to lose props to the warriors defensive intensity pretty rough shooting night when you have more rebounds than made field goals reasons to be optimistic as a cavs fan 1 timofey played strong they dont have anyone that can stop him 2 2007 andre iguodala showed up that wont happen every game 3 we are showing we can keep the splash brothers in check consistently 4 we shot horribly when we had open shots 5 our numbers are still way higher on the boards reasons to be pessimistic as a cavs fan 1 the warriors defense was really good 2 klay wont be held to 9 3 we looked gassed out there aside from one quarter 4 jr smith and iman show no signs of life 5 2 away games

the outcome of the game didnt surprise me the fact that mc hammer can afford courtside seats does though i think his wife makes a shit ton selling real estate or something yeah selling his forclosed houses httpiimgurcom929qjy3gif my man  hes playing county fairs in the bay area now that brings in the dough damn iggy is terrible at free throws game 6 is gonna be long as shit deandre iguodala what if iggy has been trolling all season long just so in a closeout game of the finals hes hacked but never misses the long con good luck fouling iggy with your 7 man roster well you just pull a mchale and bring in the 15th man to do the hacking like 75 career shooter idk whats been up with him this season and playoffs tho its weird for a couple years in philly he was a 80 ft shooter but it fell off a cliff after he left rip center position 18612015 i forgot that the center position was invented by stonewall jackson haha civil war history jokes first with lebron burning atlanta to the ground on his march to the ocean and now this poor bastard died from friendly fire itd be like losing the finals on an accidental tip in when you were trying to get the defensive board ohio native ulysses grant first fought in the east then went west this is just uncanny 2spooky4me grant then became president lebron to the wizards confirmed mozgov taking like two shots swagzeli only in there for foul calls and bogut not even playing yup its dead the whole game felt so weird without mozgovbogut 1891 dude but youre right youre wrong pick up games were happening during the civil war but theres no proof of it because you had to stand still for pics to work abe lincoln was your prototype 3 the gettysburg address was actually just a motivational halftime speech 4 score and 7 dunks ago 87 dunks at halftime who was he playing the monstars from space jam with the 3rd pick in the 1863 emancipation proclamation draft small ball is fun right now the shooters have never been better i think center is going to keep losing value till they change the 3 pt rules again widen the court and make the corners the same length as straight on no more short porch we need shaq ii to ressurrect this shit its really a damn shame that they interrupted that steady stream of commercials with a couple minutes of basketball get your shit together abc you can probably fit in a few commercials while the ball is being brought up court not just during every single time out my favorite was them cutting to commercial with 3 seconds left in the fucking half its so unbearable and they just keep milking it for fun i think ill time it so im not so bored while i wait for the actual game to come back on breaking iman shumpert to retire from the nba effective immediately due to a phobia of basketballs how many shots did he pass up tonight seriously he needs to be more assertive aggressive did game 4 break him gave up an easy layup in the second half in favor of a tristan thompson 3 on 1 dunk which he went on to missget fouled on almost seemed like he didnt even want to go to the line cause he could have easily gotten it up assertive shump blew two layups hes always been like this he ends up missing a ton of shots then loses his confidence hes simply not a good shooter that fucking pass off to tt on the lebron outlet they might as well have tossed him a hornets nest edited away from the charming but nonsensical hornets net this is what i dont understand people convinced themselves that shumpert and jr were something they arent they struggled heavily with the knicks got traded for practically nothing shumpert especially leaves so much to be desired now i miss the preacl tear shumpert at least jr has some games where you can see his ability shumpert just isnt good period he occasionally brings it on defense but i counted several big defensive mistakes by him tonight like leaving iggy wide open for a dunk off an inbounds his shooting is streaky on a good night and for a guy that walks around with a big ego he certainly tries to avoid the spotlight when it comes to actually playing basketball it sucks that the cavs are going to be paying him even more money next year exactly if youre counting on shumpert to play good defense an entire 48 youre going to be very disappointed jr smith and shumpert have played exceptionally well for the cavs theyve been playing way better than they are but in the end who they are as ball players is what youre seeing i know some fans are going to be upset with that but it is what it is lebron right now httpimgurcomjfywoh0 httpiimgurcomus3q1zqjpg that son of a bitch has done it all gained so much respect for him this series no question hes been the best player in the series id say hes one of the best teams in the nba right now if steph had this cavs team around him they wouldve been swept already thats not a knock on steph but a testament to just how much lebron has done and how little hes had to work with there should never again be a question about lebrons ability to carry i think that even before this series nobody was questioning lebrons ability to carry an inferior team to the finals him before the game httpiimgurcomx2iteavpng httpgfycatcomearnestorderlykoodoo cavs need another injury hear me out every player missing from the team increases the lebronroster ratio to optimize this lebron should play alone and thus increase the teams average skill to a maximum i feel like that logic doesnt work but i dont know enough about basketball to rebut that argument so i think youre probably right that doesnt sound righthttpimgurcomriasipyqi3zfz why is delly talking about burning trash common mistake thats actually josh mcroberts cavs get a zenkai boost every time someone goes down better yet have curry murder dellavedova in front of lebron to awaken the legend 40 point triple doubles cant melt deep benches lebron was an absolute beast once again but theres just no way he can do it all himself especially when curry is shooting like that httpimgurcomj2txz76 hes definitely playing his ass off gotta feel for him 40 points triple doubles with a loss is tough yep its like the 07 finals all over again but its 32 well this cavs team is better than 07 i get what youre saying though also this lebron james is a better and smarter player the injuries really suck lebron has done his best to make this an entertaining series more than just entertaining i still expect the cavs to take game 6 at home as a neutral and adrenaline junkie i just want a game 7 stephen kerry i love that he got called out for that he said that shit twice and then said steph kerr mike miller with the 6 i see you lebron is now 07 in the finals without wade in the building forever second fiddle freaking robin what a crazy game all those long threes curry with those two shake and bake threes on delly lebron gets his third 40 point game this series first 40point finals tripledouble in the last 30 years and iggy shoots 211 on free throws insane crazy how golden state was able to effectively shut down jr in the 2nd half i think it was a mistake playing smallball against the warriors i always felt that small ball was the way to go when you want to sacrifice size for shooting but clevelands scoring didnt see a good enough increase to warrant playing small mozgov definitely started poorly but having that big man out there causes problems for the dubs hes been a problem almost every game so far i agree mosgov is probably the most consistent player next to lebron i dunno why the cavs would play the warriors type of basketball this was great coaching from kerrrun run run in the first half by the 4th quarter you have an exhausted cavs team with lebron doing everything thats taking somebodys weakness and capitalizing on it thats how you win championships cavs really screwed up when they decided to match the pace knew from the start that the cavs would wear themselves out playing that way yeah but they really dont have any choice if they didnt match that pace in the 1st theyd be down by a lot i really like how lebron rested in the two middle quarters though thats why he still had a lot in him in the 4th too bad his teammates didnt have it then this really wouldve been a different series if the cavs had 2 extra usable players its crazy how lebron can go off for 401411 and cleveland can still lose lebron produced 70 points self and assists and they still lose 70 out of 91 saw a lot of cavs fans asking for lebrons boston game during this series this game was it and cavs still lost gotta be so disappointing for lebron hes going to need a charlotte game in order to pull out a win nah it wasnt the boston game he shot incredibly from the field he struggled a bit from the field this game still a great performance though needed a little help in the end didnt get it the westbrook triple double by 13 nonetheless theyre already missing love and irving so hes basically carrying a sub500 team in the finals without lebron this team wins maybe 20 games edit under 20 wins meaning the team without lebron kyrie or love lebron with the i dont even care that the whole world saw my dick a couple days ago game breaking news delly shirts are non refundable why did mozgov not get more minutes though kerr basically dared blatt to play mozgov by going small he basically said if hes in the game were gonna force him to be your number one option on offense blatt is smart enough to realize thats unsustainable lebron responsible for 70 of his teams 91 way to fucking carry a team i like the way jalen rose put it about this series its the best player vs the best team it was the same way last year and we know how it ended curry is vegeta to lebrons gokuhttpiimgurcomkdoe35bgifv except vegeta has trunks gohan freeza and cell for teammates while goku has 4 mr satans you mean four yamchas cant really get much worse than mr satan really when goku was looking for someone to potara fuse with he said mr satan had a power level of 1 mr satan is a joke to the z warriors but his power level is not 1 hes still one of the best human fighters in the world outside of anyone who can fly and shoot balls of pure energy lmao no matter where you are on reddit youre never more than a couple comments away from an argument about dbz krillins is more like it httpgfycatcomwarlikebossyasiaticlesserfreshwaterclam also mozgov is piccolo nah 3 krillins kyrie love and varejao they ded now but will be resurrected next season next time on nbaz the cavs travel to namek to gather the namekian dragonballs to wish back all the people who will invariably die trying to stop the evil warlord popovich 4 saibamen that gif is really well done better than the lebron one from the other day anyway there is this version of lebron let me find that one for you edit  here httpgfycatcomflimsyspitefulbutterfly i like this one a lot better its very lion king high quality did you watch the game or did you spend all your time making this gif crazy how bogut goes from starting and being a dpoy candidate to not playing a single minute in game 5 of the finals that took some balls by kerr for sure iggy better lock himself in the gym between now and game 6 and make 100000 free throws a day delly you are not that good im glad the circle jerk about him is done he did good the previous games guarding curry but now curry back to his rhythm curry hit ridiculous shots while delly was all up in his grill just unstoppable when those fall he played some great defense on curry tonight currys just kinda really good some might say mvpcalibre delly stopped shooting when he was open didnt even try 2nd year undrafted player playing 40 plus minutes a game guarding the mvp and last week being heralded as the second coming of jesus deleted fandom aside he looked like shit tonight speaking as a huge mario chalmers fan this is the chalmers effect you play with lebron and sometimes you score 25 points in an nba finals gamehttpwwwbasketballreferencecomboxscores201206190miahtml check it twice thats 70 effective fg and as many points as dwade in a real nba finals game but youre still just mario chalmers he looked like shit last game too i felt like i was taking crazy pills after game 3 im not mad im just disappointed that steph curry is a wizard pretty sure he is a warrior thanks dad warriors are 30 when blackhawks are winning on stanley cup finals its been the same outcomes blackhawks wllww warriors wllww i guess whoever wins tomorrow will tell us who will win on tuesday if steph curry didnt make those threes we woulda won the game  jr smith if iggy could shoot free throws it would be a blow out at the end of the day even if the cavs lose this series lebron got them to the finals in his first year back with a healthy loveirving and improved chemistry they have a good chance to hate fuck their way through next year excellent use of hate fuck lol yeah were cleveland i fully expect something to go terribly wrong or at least watch another team outperform us i dont even know why i watch sports i always end up sad angry and drunk by the end i honestly think that if i stopped watching sports i would become a better person its really a terrible investment all that time money and emotion and all you get in return is crushing disappointment what happened to jr after the first quarter looked like he was going to have one of the games tonight warriors took a timeout after he made back to back threes on the next possession cavs got the ball to jr again and the warriors doubled and trapped him forcing him to pass it away pretty much any time he touched the ball the rest of the first half he was getting swarmed after that i guess he fell out of rhythm or they forced the flow of the game away from him lebron james is viktor krum and the golden state warriors are team ireland this has been one of the most entertaining series in a long time i really wish kyrie had stayed healthy  would love to see lebron have just one player who wasnt a total scrub even if all he could do was hit an open jumper from a lebron dish out thatd be a help the amount of hesitancy to shoot the open three from everyone not named lebron was infuriating if curry shot tupac hed still be dead wait what there was a comment earlier that if jr smith shot tupac hed still be alive if stephen curry professional basketball player and 201415 nba most valuable player had fired a shot that impacted rapper tupac shakur said rap artist would surely be deceased at this moment gtif stephen curry professional basketball player and 201415 kia nba most valuable player had fired a shot and hit rapper tupac shakur said rap artist would be deceased at this moment thanks i was so confused there for a second thanks i was like wtf is this guy even saying cavs fans remember where you were a year ago curry gave the stankiest face after that three holy shit i wet myself httpiimgurcomxpkdomypng lebron goes 401511 and loses i think this cavs team is the worst team ive seen in the finals since the last time the cavs were in the finals appreciate greatness does anyone have insight on the lack of mozgov it doesnt make sense to me to sit him after such a great game last week can we talk about how fucking useless dellavedova is at point guard he just runs around the 3point perimeter like a jackass before giving it to lebron lebrons like i cant carry all you fools that was some rondoesque free shooting and statline by iggygg to the cavs though another 40 point performance by lebron gone to waste the only way cleveland will see a championship is if golden state wins game 6httpiimgurcomxpkdomypng httpiimgurcomqlik46dgif pretty sure they saw the spurs hoist it after game 4 yup gotdamn don do em like dat hahahahha jokes on you the spurs won on our court brb crying cold as fuck too late tim duncan beat him to it stephen curry im wardell stephen curry im just a kid from akron ohio savage it was very interesting given all the commentary that the cavs were most effective in game 4 when they went to mozgovthen in this game they essentially benched him and tried to play the warriors game you know what sucks about being on the losing side of sunday games more so during the finals you have to wake up tomorrow go to work and have all the nonbasketball fans that know youre a hardcore bball fan ask you hey so did you catch the game last night and youre like mother fuck edit this does not mean im rooting for the cavs tomorrow im the one asking questions muahaha go dubs that plot twist tho man this finals man such a shame that both kyrie and kevin got injured lebron looks like hes having fun in cleveland so far people actin like itd be impossible for a lebronled team to come back and win games 6 and 7 that being said holy fuck curry and iggy were monsters except iggy on the ft line it isnt impossible but its improbable if it happens it would be more exciting cavs fans can rest easy knowing the refing will be going for them next game nba making that money steven a smith doing everything he can to get blatt fired lol lol these russian post game interviewers are so salty with blatt have to love blatts telling off of the media httpsimgflipcomimwj3x gotta feel for king james he pretty much told his teammates you have one job make baskets they didnt hope this goes 7 games edit chef curry on the other handcoldblooded babyfaced mvp came through jr shot 414 from 3 after starting like 4 for 5 thats a jr game if ive ever seen one lebron is basically clevelands offense gt lebron is basically clevelands offense i guarantee there will be idiots who talk about how lebron couldnt deliver one of those idiots may even get 2 hours of screen time each day to do just that nothing but respect for lebron i wouldnt feel too bad for him though hell have another shot next season and the season after that and the season after that lebron might as well be playing with dleaguers that would be the 2007 cavs these are at least cleaguers s cle eaguers eh mozgovs been playing pretty well this series i cant imagine what would happen to cavs if lebron had injured himself instead of kyrie probably it would be the most embarrassing final for a team remember when delly could shut down curry hes still playing great d curry has just started to hit the tough contested shots lebron james needs help somebody anybody help this man hes surrounded by mediocrity

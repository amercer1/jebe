IMMEDIATELY
DUE
TO
A
PHOBIA
OF

HOW
MANY
SHOTS
DID
HE
PASS
UP
TONIGHT
SERIOUSLY
HE
NEEDS
TO
BE
MORE
ASSERTIVE
AGGRESSIVE
DID

HIM
GAVE

AN

HE
WENT

CAUSE
HE
COULD

EASILY
GOTTEN
IT
UP
ASSERTIVE
SHUMP
BLEW
TWO
LAYUPS
HES
ALWAYS
BEEN
LIKE
THIS
HE
ENDS
UP
MISSING
A
TON
OF
SHOTS
THEN
LOSES
HIS
CONFIDENCE
HES
SIMPLY
NOT
A
GOOD
SHOOTER
THAT
FUCKING
PASS
OFF
TO
TT
ON
THE
LEBRON
OUTLET
THEY
MIGHT
AS
WELL
HAVE
TOSSED
HIM
A
HORNETS
NEST
EDITED
AWAY
FROM
THE
CHARMING
BUT
NONSENSICAL
HORNETS
NET
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
PEOPLE
CONVINCED
THEMSELVES
THAT
SHUMPERT
AND
JR
WERE
SOMETHING
THEY
ARENT
THEY
STRUGGLED
HEAVILY
WITH
THE
KNICKS
GOT
TRADED
FOR
PRACTICALLY
NOTHING
SHUMPERT
ESPECIALLY
LEAVES
SO
MUCH
TO
BE
DESIRED
NOW
I
MISS
THE

SHUMPERT
AT

JR
HAS
SOME
GAMES
WHERE
YOU
CAN
SEE
HIS
ABILITY
SHUMPERT
JUST
ISNT
GOOD
PERIOD
HE
OCCASIONALLY
BRINGS
IT
ON
DEFENSE
BUT
I
COUNTED
SEVERAL
BIG
DEFENSIVE
MISTAKES
BY
HIM
TONIGHT
LIKE
LEAVING
IGGY
WIDE
OPEN
FOR
A
DUNK
OFF
AN
INBOUNDS
HIS
SHOOTING
IS
STREAKY
ON
A
GOOD
NIGHT
AND
FOR
A
GUY
THAT
WALKS
AROUND
WITH
A
BIG
EGO
HE
CERTAINLY
TRIES
TO
AVOID
THE
SPOTLIGHT
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
ACTUALLY
PLAYING
BASKETBALL
IT
SUCKS
THAT
THE
CAVS
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
PAYING
HIM
EVEN
MORE
MONEY
NEXT

EXACTLY
IF
YOURE
COUNTING
ON
SHUMPERT
TO
PLAY
GOOD
DEFENSE
AN
ENTIRE

YOURE
GOING
TO
BE
VERY
DISAPPOINTED
JR
SMITH
AND
SHUMPERT
HAVE
PLAYED
EXCEPTIONALLY
WELL
FOR
THE
CAVS
THEYVE
BEEN
PLAYING

BETTER
THAN
THEY
ARE

IN

THEY
ARE

AROUND

THEY
WOULDVE

NOT

HOW

I
THINK
IT
WAS
A
MISTAKE
PLAYING

AGAINST

I
ALWAYS
FELT
THAT
SMALL
BALL
WAS
THE
WAY
TO
GO
WHEN
YOU

BUT
HAVING

OUT
THERE
CAUSES

FOR

PROBLEM
ALMOST
EVERY
GAME
SO
FAR
I
AGREE
MOSGOV
IS
PROBABLY
THE
MOST
CONSISTENT
PLAYER
NEXT
TO

I
DUNNO
WHY
THE

WOULD
PLAY
THE
WARRIORS
TYPE
OF
BASKETBALL
THIS
WAS
GREAT
COACHING
FROM
KERRRUN
RUN
RUN
IN
THE
FIRST
HALF
BY
THE
4TH
QUARTER
YOU
HAVE
AN
EXHAUSTED
CAVS
TEAM
WITH
LEBRON
DOING
EVERYTHING
THATS
TAKING
SOMEBODYS
WEAKNESS
AND
CAPITALIZING
ON
IT
THATS
HOW
YOU
WIN
CHAMPIONSHIPS
CAVS
REALLY
SCREWED
UP
WHEN
THEY
DECIDED
TO
MATCH
THE
PACE
KNEW
FROM
THE
START
THAT
THE
CAVS
WOULD
WEAR
THEMSELVES
OUT
PLAYING
THAT
WAY
YEAH
BUT
THEY
REALLY
DONT
HAVE
ANY
CHOICE
IF
THEY
DIDNT
MATCH
THAT
PACE
IN
THE
1ST
THEYD
BE
DOWN
BY
A
LOT
I
REALLY
LIKE
HOW
LEBRON
RESTED
IN
THE
TWO
MIDDLE
QUARTERS
THOUGH
THATS
WHY
HE
STILL
HAD
A
LOT
IN
HIM
IN
THE
4TH
TOO
BAD
HIS
TEAMMATES
DIDNT
HAVE
IT
THEN
THIS
REALLY
WOULDVE
BEEN
A
DIFFERENT
SERIES
IF
THE
CAVS
HAD
2
EXTRA
USABLE
PLAYERS
ITS
CRAZY
HOW
LEBRON
CAN
GO
OFF
FOR

AND
CLEVELAND
CAN
STILL
LOSE

70

CLEVELAND
I
FULLY
EXPECT
SOMETHING
TO
GO
TERRIBLY
WRONG
OR
AT
LEAST
WATCH
ANOTHER
TEAM
OUTPERFORM
US
I
DONT
EVEN
KNOW
WHY
I
WATCH
SPORTS
I
ALWAYS
END
UP
SAD
ANGRY
AND
DRUNK
BY
THE
END
I
HONESTLY
THINK
THAT
IF
I
STOPPED
WATCHING
SPORTS
I
WOULD
BECOME
A
BETTER
PERSON
ITS
REALLY
A
TERRIBLE
INVESTMENT
ALL
THAT
TIME
MONEY
AND
EMOTION
AND
ALL
YOU
GET
IN
RETURN
IS
CRUSHING
DISAPPOINTMENT
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
JR
AFTER
THE
FIRST
QUARTER
LOOKED
LIKE
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
HAVE
ONE
OF
THE
GAMES
TONIGHT
WARRIORS
TOOK
A
TIMEOUT
AFTER
HE
MADE
BACK
TO
BACK
THREES
ON
THE
NEXT
POSSESSION
CAVS
GOT
THE
BALL
TO
JR
AGAIN
AND
THE
WARRIORS
DOUBLED
AND
TRAPPED
HIM
FORCING
HIM
TO
PASS
IT
AWAY
PRETTY
MUCH
ANY
TIME
HE
TOUCHED
THE
BALL
THE
REST
OF
THE
FIRST
HALF
HE
WAS
GETTING
SWARMED
AFTER
THAT
I
GUESS
HE
FELL
OUT
OF
RHYTHM
OR
THEY
FORCED
THE
FLOW
OF
THE
GAME
AWAY
FROM
HIM
LEBRON
JAMES
IS
VIKTOR
KRUM
AND
THE
GOLDEN
STATE
WARRIORS
ARE
TEAM
IRELAND
THIS
HAS
BEEN
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
ENTERTAINING
SERIES
IN
A
LONG
TIME
I
REALLY
WISH
KYRIE
HAD
STAYED
HEALTHY

WOULD
LOVE
TO
SEE
LEBRON
HAVE
JUST
ONE
PLAYER
WHO
WASNT
A
TOTAL
SCRUB
EVEN
IF
ALL
HE
COULD
DO
WAS
HIT
AN
OPEN
JUMPER
FROM
A
LEBRON
DISH
OUT
THATD
BE
A
HELP
THE
AMOUNT
OF
HESITANCY
TO
SHOOT
THE
OPEN
THREE
FROM
EVERYONE
NOT
NAMED
LEBRON
WAS
INFURIATING
IF
CURRY
SHOT
TUPAC

STILL
BE
DEAD
WAIT
WHAT
THERE
WAS
A
COMMENT
EARLIER
THAT
IF
JR
SMITH
SHOT
TUPAC

STILL
BE
ALIVE
IF

MOST
VALUABLE

HAD
FIRED
A
SHOT
THAT
IMPACTED

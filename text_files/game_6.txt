good ol jr smith knocking down 3s at the end of the game to force us on the east coast to stay up an extra 10 minutes such a jr smith move lebron james is officially not the best team in basketball you mean the cleveland lebroniers i swear guys jr smith will go off next game what opening nighnight 49 pts 13 reb and 28 ast tp go along with 23 steals tag me if im wrong ill jack off to preggo porn i will if im right also though respect for staying true to your word that was the most jr game ever i believed for a second there jr was gonna send this into ot then he jrd that turn around 3 i thought the dubs had a game after that but nah jr thats his shit he lives for that 15 point comeback oh shit its the finalshttp2bpblogspotcomtqpymtdmsusuvfhh95g90iaaaaaaaacnihx6v2u9mrnws16001gif i need this playoff bonus to make the monthly payment on that segway does the dude smoke weed before games he looks high as shit i think he got hit in the nose right before this i bet when he plays 2k he lets his team get down by 30 points and uses his own character to comeback and win the game live by the jr die by the jr you try to get the pipe the pipe gets you jr defies all logic and probabilities a true enigma late as fuck to the party classic fuck you threes lebron wouldve had the record for percentage of team points scored in a finals series until jr jrd the most jr series ever bill russell needing help standing  he shouldnt have to be there on stage i love bill russell too much to let him be herded on stage to be glossed over like that  im sure he insisted on it but id rather he not strain himself too much just saw kerr joke with him and say that they only need 10 more to catch him and bill did his signature laugh i didnt catch that that is beautiful i knew i loved steve kerr bills a san francisco native made us all happy to see him up there yeah thats the first time ive seen him look truly old its making me tear up a bit wellat least he had a knee brace on the outside it couldve been a recent injury thats healing he did laugh at kerrs ring joke during the entire finals mvp presentation i kept telling myself who is this fuccboi holding up bill russell dude has 11 rings he doesnt need you honestly though that was just me deflecting my immense sadness at seeing my heroes become old im so happy to see bill live this long especially as a tall dude because they dont seem to have great luck at seeing 80 years but seeing him show even the slightest sign of weakness just put a lot of sadness into my heart im glad that hes only experiencing physical detriments instead of mental though because having a sharp mind in your 80s is much more important than having a sharp body i dunno basically i just love bill russell and seeing him show any signs of weakness makes me sad atleast i can now say that we got swept by the nba champions now gentry get your ass to new orleans anthony davis is waiting for you yeah it sucks that cleveland wont win a chip because ad is going to win them back to back for the next 20 years and they will just rename basketball davisball edit okay i get it you guys are more clever than i am browsketball it is browsketball my body is ready did you see what gentry said in the locker room he shouted at the camera saying ad we coming back here next year hope you guys treat him well love that guy haha the game ends with jr smith scaring the shit out of me i honestly thought he was about to tmac thankfully he jred if you jred when youre supposed to tmac youre gonna have a bad time jr smith with the most jr last 5 minutes i was starting to believe jr smith could shoot like jr smith thinks he can shoot lol fucking dead at this comment jr and josh smith could be the best duo in basketball if they both played as well as they think they could play klay gon hit the bong tonight jr gonna lay the pipe tonight jr will lay the pipe very sadly tonight its the offseason now what kind of sandwich is your favorite player delly

ky wait what he had on his beasley face for most of this series how brutal is this celebration compared to the blackhawks one yesterday an interview just as the team is being awarded the trophy get the fuck off the stage yeah it loses its charm real quick you wanna see them celebrate and be happy instead i watch doris burke playing hide and seek with their starting 5 does abc not understand that most of america wants to see the players celebrate no one cares about doris burke no one wants to see her ask questions give them 10 or 15 minutes and then maybe we would like some insight shout out to uhandrewbrozel for streaming the entire playoffs you da real final mvp shout out to everyone who watched and made this so much fun all year cant wait for next season doesnt matter got a ringhttppbstwimgcommediachrc8hiveaeoalajpg when you know hannah stocking is waiting for you after the game dude im trying to go to sleep dont make me google her to myself definitely

okay for the first two links but that third one threw me overboard that last pic was just wow yo her snapchat story consists of 0 klay thompson ever when you barely help on the group project but still get an a thats the most perfect description ever haha to be fair he contributed for 99 of the year cant wait to see that everywhere i remember this from twitter as well and this season is dellevadover how long you been waiting to say that a dellevalong time httpiimgurcomhjurylvjpg klay thompson reminds me of a high school drug dealer serial episode 13 the deal with klay httpiimgurcomdnjwep2png steve kerr to blatt it wouldve been different if you guys were healthy good sportsmanship and respectful game great series great season for us cleveland has lots to look forward to yes fuck you you gorgeous little slut blatt kerrs persistent professionalism is amazing he gave a shout out to all of his heroes and coaches basically giving them the credit for his own hard fought amazing season and win and then gives all other credit left to his team he has the build to be as curry would have said tonight a very special coach i hope for a lot of success for him in the coming years somewhere in a dusty old bar in the middle of arizona mike dantoni and steve nash are celebrating happy that a team of shooters finally won living vicariously through kerr curry and former coach gentry elsewhere charles barkley is munching on the bricks jr and shumpert threw up tonight living through barbosa iggy finals mvp holy shit championship recipe elite defensive sf without huge scoring responsibilities players like iggy and kawhi have become a necessity for a team with nba title aspirations especially to win one against lebron james lebron stoppers edit i get it no one is stopping lebron i should have said make life harder for lebroners more like lebron slowerdowners but yeah holy smokes just let them celebrate this is what the press conference is for lady has to talk to every player we championship  barbosa breaking ray allen just signed with the golden state warriors minutes prior to the end of gametime cavs 01 since seeing jurassic world as a team should have seen mad max witness meeeeeeeee where was 4th quarter jr smith the rest of the series some say he is still waiting for game 7 i was alive when a team other than detroit chicago houston san antonio la boston miami and dallas won the nba championship no teams other than detroit chicago houston san antonio la boston miami dallas and oakland have won a finals since 1767 this is almost believable boston won the finals in 1781 at yorktown and thats the one that really mattered cornwallis only shot 23 from the ocean in that series iirc 1781 didnt have the advanced metrics we have now though 23 was league average from ocean oh nice bro me too i guess i wasnt  rip thats actually a pretty long list time to go home and celebratehttpiimgurcomjbb1ofpjpg if i lived in columbus i dont think id ever stop using that gif ah yes toledo instead good choice lol klay rejecting doris doris just get the fuck out give them some mother fucking time to celebrate doris burke is so awkward it was extremely weird not seeing stuart scott up there rip stuart scott well i think in the end this series turned out how everyone expected it to be cleveland put up a good fight those first three games and damn was it worth as a european to stay awake till 6am for those games but starting game 4 golden state hit all those shots they normally do and from there it went downhill for cleveland having just one player performing is not enogh even if its lebron james was really feeling for lebron just because i root for the underdogs in scenarios like this and wanted cleveland to win with all the bad luck the city had and what a great story it would be for lebron to bring that title home in the end its a lot of what ifs what if cavs win that close first game too what if kyrie and love are not hurt what if not only lebron would perform but holy smokes did the warriors play beautiful basketball and deserve that title they were the better team and simply played better congrats to them ive already posted something similar so ill try not repeat myself too much its incredible that cleveland wen this far with losing 23 best players two allstars i cannot name another team in the league that couldve done that maybe im biased but i really cant so naturally with 51 years of drought i cant tell you how unfair it feels that both kyrie and love got hurt i also do not want to take anything away from golden state they played and were coached phenomenal all season long i actually like all their players too except for draymond green that guy can go fuck himself the fan base is great there in oakland and its nice to see them get a championship after all these years im happy for your guys even as it came at our expense as a sidenote sometimes you start to psych yourself out that its impossible for cleveland to win a championship you start believing the curse and that no matter what we do something crazy like losing 3 out of your starting 5 players  remember varejao was hurt too will happen and we will lose having gotten my little self pity out of the way the warriors fans are great and its nice to see oakland win great coach the superstar is a classact congratulations i hope to see you in the finals next year and i hope that our team plane wont drop down from the sky or some shit so we can battle it out full strength the olynyks send their regards lebron made the decision to sacrifice kyrie irving hoping that the basketball gods would bless the team lebron is basically stannis for the heat funny that kelly olynyk had a bigger impact on the finals than half the people that played in it fuck you james michael macadoo fuck kelly olynk fuck olly rfuckolly dont hit this link if you havent seen the got finale httpiimgurcomowik5xgpng we have officially lived by the 3 just because a story doesnt have a happy ending doesnt make it a bad story props to david blatt he is all class man lbj really needed help injuries fucking suck would have been nice if one shooter showed up for them jones 623  26 smith 2477  31 shump 1143  26 delly 1553  28 pretty abysmal  anyway congrats to the warriors super happy for iggy finally getting his ring and he had a fantastic series edit iggy got mvp too damn the cavs team was basically lebron and mozgov and tt those three had 10 rebounds tonight coincidentally i cant believe how poorly jr shot this whole series shumpert and delly i buy but jr did not play or shoot to his potential gtjr did not play or shoot to his potential isnt that the story of jr cavaliers postfinals photohttpiimgurcomhyy14yrjpg ok respect to mozgov and tt httpiimgurcomxpkdomypng wow last year kawhi and this year iggy who would have picked these two to be finals mvps klay high af he dont know whats going on haha that championship ceremony was awkward im happy for iggy finally getting some recognition and kerr is a smart coach iggy doesnt sound like he has the right voice for his body he sounds like the nerd in middle school that found out he was good in sports and suddenly got popular in high school httpspbstwimgcommediachrfg44ueaew_zkjpg rip stuart scott the finals just arent the same without you i am the bone of my salt sodium is my body and chloride is my blood i have posted in over a thousand game threads unknown to trophies nor known to rings have withstood pain to watch many losses yet those eyes will never behold anything so as i pray unlimited cavs works cavsstay saltzero staring lebron as saber berserker archer etc lebron is literally all the servants fate staynight reference in rnba never thought id see a fate reference in rnba andre igoudala is the finals mvp i cant put to words how happy i am for him shoutout to uhandrewbrozel for the streaming generosity they said he was too small and too frail but now hes at the top of the nba will have a nice career in turkey if hes lucky turkeys pretty competitive ill be honest back when steph curry came out of college i said he wouldnt be good in the nba i was wrong i was dead absolutely wrong i was wrong a thousand times wow i feel really stupid looking back and thinking about that nah outback jesus lost get the fuck off doris way too much time let them celebrate god damn it am i the only one cringing at this postgame trophy ceremony i agree the interviews really dont need to be done this way let them celebrate i like how doris burke just went to asking questions when they didnt even give them the trophy yet also no you gotta bring riley come on steph please just give it a break doris adam silver is possibly a worse public speaker than david stern can you speak with any confidence damn son spispispit that shit out congratulations to golden state warriors what a playoff what a lovely playoff whats this the spurs coming out of the tunnel with the briefcase its the spurs music its the spurs music bah gawd king is that the argentine assassin manu tuning up the band for the euro step were cashing in now bitches thats tim duncans music man this is an awkward trophy presentation i feel terrible for golden state having to celebrate in the city of cleveland is very unfortunate looks like delly was a false prophet after all doris burke makes me wanna throw up i always dislike when champions win at opponent arenas it seems so empty and lifeless httpiimgurcomxqxw9ujpng if youd told me last season that the warriors would win 67 games and go to the finals i woulda thought you were delusional good season congrats warriors breaking ray allen to sign with golden state warriors breaking lebron announces he will miss the 20152016 season with a hurt back from carrying his team through the finals im so happy for shawn livingston commish awkward as fuck well lebron still wins the mvp no matter what  most viewed penis doris is so cringe worthy fck klay klaaaay thompsan god hates cleveland before the overreactions start let me say congratulations to the golden state warriors for winning the finals they absolutely earned it and deserve it for being the best team in the nba second i have gained so much respect for lebron fucking james he played the best offensive and defensive team with no real help to help carry the load from his team he gave it his everything every game and you can see that in his stats and game you can tell he just gave up when curry made that easy up in a game 6 elimination game no kyrie irving no kevin love i honestly do believe these finals could have ended differently in 7 games had the cavs had a healthy team until then i will see you guys next season next season youre gonna miss all the great offseason threads is dwane casy better than lebron it already smells like offseason over at rsunshttpwwwredditcomrsunscomments39zh4yshe_looks_a_bit_like_nash if you could have added one power ranger to the cavs roster to help with roster depletion which one would you pick seeing how happy iggys son was makes me so happy its always disappointing doesnt matter if im playing in miami or if im playing in cleveland or if im playing on mars lebron space jam 2 confirmed if you had told me before the season that steph curry and klay thompson would win an nba championship before kevin durant and russell westbrook i would not have believed you congratulations to golden state how salty is mark jackson right now all of it hey kobe whats lebrons record in the finalhttpimgurcomejqyokj something that might not get acknowledged but a main reason they made it this far is because of bogut sucks that they couldnt strategically fit him in during finals but during regular season he was one of their key players im so happy that shaun livingston is a nba champ kerr glistening with champagne is making me hot ive had espn on for about 25 minutes its been lebroncavs pieces pretty much nonstop im not a warriors fan by any means but id be pretty upset if im sitting at home waiting to hear the national media give my team its props for winning and its just piece after piece about the team my team just beat for the championship this is really lame its like 6 straight pieces on lebron they didnt have any pretaped pieces on the warriors or what

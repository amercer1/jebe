first cavs finals victory in franchise history damn i hadnt thought about this thats gotta feel nice oh my god youre right this seems to be getting lost in here congrats congrats didnt even think about that thats huge that camera shot where they showed lebron getting hit across the arms and then pans out to show tony brothers staring right at it made me want to punch my tv yeah i really cant understand how he misses that he is less than a foot or two away and hes staring right at it when i pause my dvr you can see him looking right at the play when iggy rakes him across the arms then when lebron argues he just keeps shaking his head no blows my mind thats cause he didnt miss it he just didnt wanna call it fuck that ref httpiimgurcomqaessk6png its official lebron can only win a finals game with wade in the building bravo did jr smith have money on golden state or what i knew the cavs would win once he fouled out dude has the lowest basketball iq ive ever seen dude was playing with his heart and not his head all night very frustrating to watch its part of the jr package as long as you are getting the effort however i think you will have a jr that gets back on track when the man gets hot he gets hot at least he was actually playing with his heart and not just being out there for no reason with jr who the fuck knows the good news is we probably dont have to see either brothers or foster again until next year actually theyre not officiating for this series no more thank god they usually minimize the number of times a referee is used in a series this tony brothers crew is terrible we gave had them at least once in each series in the playoffs on the bright sidethey miss calls both ways i guess gtuntil next year still seems too soon dellavedova went from being undrafted to on the bench for the cavs to starting when irving was injured to shutting down the mvp dellavedova is the ultimate nba2k myplayer id drop mad vc to use his accent as an aussie its amusing to choose between cocky black guy voice and cocky black guy voice 2 too bad that next time he gets a sit down with the gm they will say they wish he would try harder before getting more minutes then he will demand a trade to somewhere where they need a new dminded pg sadly he will be sent to phoenix who recovered isiah thomas and goran dragic while also acquiring chris paul accurate 2k experience only got 1 assist though so hes definitely going to get blasted on twitter man the warriors sure could have used those 2 points from that speights dunk post game interview everything lebron james after the second question i said to the wife i hope he answers everything again no matter what the next question might be he did kyrie died for this who would have thought that a little white dude nicknamed outback jesus may have just saved the cavs season matthew curry stopper dellavedova ruben patterson must smiling somewhere matthew i dont give no fucks about riley imma disrespect yo daddy dellavedova sorry riley but im dad dicking your dad finals mvphttpmedia2newsnet5comphoto20150605matthew_dellavedova__the_early_years_3030680002_19276047_ver10_640_480jpg httpsiimgurcomdjfvs5ijpg everybody post your rare dellyshttpiimgurcomn5pyplxpng woohoo delly do it for the southern hemisphere beautiful defense tight as possible without fouling hands up all the time even when he had a bad matchup tons of effort i never knew he could be that good dont talk shit about delly stephen a smith he wouldnt dare delly is going to be his close personal friend after tonight we hungout in australia together i had bloomin onions with him and my family skip i personally cooked shrimps on the barbie for him skip personally like only a dear dear friend would matthew dellevadova is a dear dear friend he has made love to my wife and my dear mother he has delivered me from evil many many times whatd he say deleted he said he shouldnt be on the court in the finals because he couldnt even dribble the ball charles barkley looking at stephs shooting statshttps38mediatumblrcomb57d289be7c6d70bfcfbea5564f3f779tumblr_nif1swcxkg1tp80nvo1_400gif erneh this kid dallievenodah flawless delledova is such a pest on defense dellanevoda curry postgame interviewhttpsstreamablecomi9ts replace that with delly why do i watch sportsmy heart doesnt need this this is too much how is anyone alive after these two games lol i had to get a pacemaker in ot cavs you want the ball man golden state nah man you take it cavs you sure deleted that reffing was very suspicious especially in ot it was suspect the whole game we can all agree fuck those refs fuck tony brothers that dude has to be blind if cavs lost the game those refs were gonna need to have escorts back to the hotel fortunately for this hypothetical the game was in oakland so they needed an escort anyway to shield them from the swarms of happy fans outside of oracle tony must know something truly terrible about the nba that cant get out there is no way this guy can consistently be bad and still have a job fuck the missed hacks and fuck them not doing something about the ridiculous travels seriously i was seeing some 5 steppers more lebron than anyone else but its absurd and the fouls on god damn jump balls seriously how can you miss half of this shit i just dont understand how nobody managed to see draymond green act as lebron james backpack on the jumpball right middle of the floor all eyes on them one of the refs had to see that james jones game high 19 goat 5 finals appearances in a row for a reason and espn with the ultimate disrespect not including james goat jones with nonceltics players who have reached the finals 5 straight times disrespect its a funny looking stat but he really was such a huge spark felt like he was the big difference between this team and last games cavs even more so than kyrie being out i wonder if lebron ever gives the wrong personalized handshakes to his teammates if the cavs lost i would have felt so bad absolutely atrocious officiating httpsvinecovemvvo6ia3ek absolutely blatant fouls if that clip played a second or two longer it would show tony standing right there eyes glazed over tongue half out if the cavs had lost i would have downed a bottle of vodka and wrote a letter to the nba about their officials in comic sans fucking refs trying to take over the fucking game get fucked refs shaq were live i dont give a shit i know obligatoryhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvajcy_mjhlng when youre outplayed by a dude named outback jesushttpimgurcomxqxx8a4 if lebron played like steph did tonight this sub would be brewing up a colossal shitstorm yeah lets not mince words curry was terrible and he made some pretty big mistakes at the end lebron would have been getting demolished or if he air balled the game trying shot with 4 seconds left the choking comments would have lasted for weeks gtthe choking comments would have lasted for weeks years no travels no fouls only basketball well the bullshit calls down the stretch were absolutely ridiculous sigh aside from that dellys defence on curry was absolutely stellar in a finals game i cant believe that many calls were blown the nba should be embarrassed by this game we won and hopefully tony brothers wont call any more playoff games after that debacle everything could work out he is the worst referee in the league you know its bad when youre pining for joey crawford to call games other than some theatrics and a few egregious techs id trust crawford more than most other refs in the game for real ball did not lie this just in lebron mugged leaving the arena police say no call smh they took everythang when the cops came his only word when asked what happened was everything sir can you tell us what they took from you everything they took everything oh what a game what a lovely game i shoot i miss i shoot again  jr smith more like steph curry tonight witness me lebron james edit delly is totally a war boy makes too much sense delly is shine as fck father i am disappoint riley i want to change my name to riley dellavedova what the fuck curry he does have a masters in disasters too many missed calls probably a really satisfying win for the cavs though knowing kyrie is out being down 1 and playing away from home steph curry stabs lebron in the chest 7 times refs hesitantly call foul gs fans booooooo you gotta let them play lets ask secaucus if 7 stabbing wounds is a flagrant 1 or just a hard foul chef currys kitchen was shut down by health inspector delly tonight httpsiimgurcomrmdsxhjpg honestly dellavedovas playing is motivating me to work harder and be better if hes up there getting rebounds and going for loose balls in the fucking nba theres no reason i cant be doing well on a fucking diii swim team i was alive when lebron james was playing in the nba oh yeah i was alive when matthew dellavedova was playing so sit down man kyrie and love are sitting for me so was jr thank goodness oh boy jr almost blew this for yall 391611 how do people still doubt this man lebron james a man so absurdly good at basketball that people look at his field goal percentage and think he should have played a better 391611 the best part is he shouldve had even more than 39 there were at least 6 of the missed fga that i can count off the top of my head where he was clearly and blatantly fouled to no call me too what was it like u wouldnt even understand mom ugh it was aight those refs have no place officiating a playoff game ever again great game horrible officiating nba were gonna need a super sayian gif made out of lebrons scream at the end of the game edit heres the clip if anyone is interestedhttpstreamablecomllwk there are other better angles they showed but i havent been able to find them  39 points  16 rebounds  11 assists  willed his team to victory in overtime on the road against the best team in the league on the biggest stage of them all thats why they call him the king he played 50httpwwwcspanorgvideo3207485washingtonjournalarchitectsengineers911truth fucking minutes 1 gw away from 20 lead 93 points for the warriors in overtime dont tell me david blatt cant coach hes undermanned and still has this group playing absolutely elite this has to be a defensive team if theyre going to have a chance yeah thats something i forgot golden state lost playing at home with a full strength team against a cavs team that have key players mia props to blatt lebron and delly for stepping up to the challenge mozgov man mazgov and tt have also been beast dont leave them out james jones coming off the bench was also pretty clutch for them he is damned good not playing mozgov aside when they went small he didnt have a choice maybe but tristan just went completely cold on offense and wasnt rotating to the rim risky gamble but tt can defend wing players well good news is that the cavs are much better on defense without love and a not 100 kyrie just have to hope they have enough in the tank to last all series would this be a good thread in which to post bucks in 6 so if lebron keeps playing like this and the cavs do end up winning the series could this go down as the greatest performance in finals history or am i over exaggerating i know his efficiency tonight was not the best but god damn he is like a fucking one man army out there he wants this championship bad if cavs somehow pull this out the efficiency wont mean diddly squat that would be in my opinion one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of the nba the narrative of it all is off the charts storybook stuff coming home cleveland of all cities winning a title one of the greatest players ever  a player criticized for choosing super teams  winning a championship with no other stars left against one of the greatest regular seasons teams of all time greatest finals performance ever who knows but would be one of the greatest narrativesstories in nba history thats no doubt if this happens i can see even warriors fans and lebron haters being okay with that it would mean that weve witnessed history right in front of us and the best thing to do is just appreciate it yeah if lebron keeps this up i dont think thered be a finals performance to compare from anyone hes averaging over 4098 right now thats fucking retarded hes played 96 minutes in 2 games he has nothing but the role players hes pg sg pf all in one while trying to defend fuck man calling it a one man army would be a disrespect to how well the whole team played taking nothing away from lebron so far it is probably up there among the best finals performances but goddamn has he gotten his team to step up without their two other stars i am in love with mozgov and delly true delly was outstanding tonight seriously i was really worried about how the cavs would cope without kyrie but if delly plays like that theyre in pretty good shape it feels like theyre rallying around those injuries and using them as motivation if they manage to win this series without kevin love and kyrie thats just insane i cant think of any other team in the league that could lose two of their best three players two all stars as well and still make the playoffs let alone potentially win the finals though no other team has lebron on it but still thats crazy if he manages to win this series with this injured cavs in spite of how much i dont want him to win hes number 1 for me hes literally carrying not just his team but all of fucking ohio on his back imo this cavs team just beat the warriors in golden state without kevin love or kyrie irvinggod damn lebron james is fucking good their defense is fucking good as well under 60 points over 3 quarters for the first time this season team defense wins i am officially a witness i was alive when dellavedova was playing in the nba ama request utobydoggy how good was delly steph james harden curry jumping into defenders trying to draw a foul on the last gsw shot currys become what he despised most kerr even pulled a hackathompson so theyre stealing the rockets game plan you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain they both broke records tos and missed 3pt shots were witnessing history guys i cant believe im writing this but im totally a lebron fan now i used to fucking haaaate this guy but to see him pull out a win like that with this kind of supporting cast im looking at you jr smith with their backs against the wall damn damn damn go lebron go cavs lets fucking go our first finals win in our fucking history as a franchise thank christ the cavs won that i dont even have a dog in this fight and i was getting so pissed at the officiating david stern would never let the leagues superstar get jobbed on fouls like that i wish theyd cut to currys family when he airballed any other mvp would get absolutely roasted for playing that dog turd of a game for some reason it doesnt seem like anyone really cares that steph was absolutely atrocious all night but riley curry cavs deserved to win this game can lebron get a fucking call im exhausted despite a late rally by the refs the cavs manage to hold on for the win thats some poetic justice if ive ever seen it fuck scott foster tony brothers was literally staring right at iggy when he hacked the shit outta james in ot fuck both of dem losers fuck all the people who said were only here because were in the east those guys are fighters and definitely proved they deserve to be here lets go back to the q and take this shit it seems boguts history of pushing the limits with sneaky fouls caught up with him he got caught on a few like that tonight hopefully bogut adapts or continues to get called live by the 3 die by the 3 the refs were absolutely horrible but they couldnt stop the king couldnt stop outback jesus  lebron was absolutely shafted by the refs down the stretch like 5 obvious fouls not called in a row never seen anything like it especially for a superstar like lebron dellaevedova was an absolute monster who actually overshadowed a lebron triple double what a fucking clutch performance from him well see how curry deals with a little adversity here hes not gonna sleep well tonight after this one can we all agree that the refereeing was absolute shit today for both teams also delly for mvp lol in ot it definitely wasnt shit for both teams only cavs im not even a cavs fan and i was royally pissed i cant imagine being a cavs fan watching that game fucking brutal if i wasnt at my grandfathers visiting him to watch the game i wouldve been screaming swear words i said enough to cover you dont worry buddy i swear brothers just was staring at lebrons ass that play missed a travel and a foul hypnotized by lebooty gotta say it was more shittier for the cavs especially since their bad calls occurred in some extremely crucial situations this was a ridiculous game the cavs should have closed out the game easily in regular time lebron had a massive game but wasnt efficient down the stretch the refs were atrocious on both sides but more visibly with so many missed foul calls the basketball gods will spare us because the cavs deserved the win but lets hope the rest of this series isnt as controversial also delly is my new favorite player huge huge praise for outback jesus he made the mvp look lost took all of his airspace away went over screens and fought threw them hard hit some shots hustled for everything while everyone was standing he crashed and grabbed that all important o board and hit the clutch fts then forces a curry airball next possession came into starting lineup and did his part really happy and proud with his effort and heart mvp of the game lebron with another good game although not the most efficient offensively he got everyone involved all while getting his own shots in please stop fading away on your shot that deep shot he made late in 4th shows how much better his shot is when he sways correctly instead of just flinging himself back i get they want bron to hit the last shots but at least give him an opening set a screen create a possible mismatch dont just dump it high in the wing for a chuck up 3 jr with some horrible plays down the stretch cmon man klay thompson was on fire early in the game questionable fouls took him out early really good job stepping up when your main star is struggling dray mind with a huge defensive impact that block on bron wow clean af overall much much better effort by cavs and way better ball movement this game still some standing iso for lebron but at least there was moving players most times but that was a big mental collapse end of 4th resorted to more iso again move the ball doesnt need to be a lebron deep shot get a shooter open there were some weird calls i really didnt like especially towards the end for both sides and most importantly i really agree with jvg as a defender you should have the right to jump to defend and its not fair if you let the shooter just jump into you thats horseshit great game although hampered by the questionable calls but whatever this is a hell of a series tbh i thought the cavs were completely done but now i feel like warriors will have to play really hard to win god damn fool you wrote a novel while the game was still being played i dont think ive ever seen someone pretype a forum comment

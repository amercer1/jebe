COULD

IF

CAN

BEING

WITH
THAT
IT

AND
THE
BEST

TO
DO
IS
JUST
APPRECIATE
IT

BE

IF

IF
THEY

WITHOUT

THATS

LEBRON
WAS
ABSOLUTELY
SHAFTED
BY
THE
REFS
DOWN
THE
STRETCH
LIKE
5
OBVIOUS
FOULS
NOT
CALLED
IN
A
ROW
NEVER
SEEN
ANYTHING
LIKE

ESPECIALLY
FOR
A
SUPERSTAR
LIKE
LEBRON
DELLAEVEDOVA
WAS
AN
ABSOLUTE
MONSTER
WHO
ACTUALLY
OVERSHADOWED
A
LEBRON
TRIPLE
DOUBLE
WHAT
A
FUCKING
CLUTCH

LITTLE
ADVERSITY
HERE

AGREE
THAT
THE
REFEREEING
WAS
ABSOLUTE
SHIT
TODAY
FOR
BOTH
TEAMS
ALSO
DELLY
FOR
MVP
LOL
IN
OT
IT
DEFINITELY
WASNT
SHIT
FOR
BOTH
TEAMS
ONLY
CAVS
IM
NOT
EVEN
A
CAVS
FAN
AND
I
WAS
ROYALLY
PISSED
I
CANT
IMAGINE
BEING
A
CAVS
FAN
WATCHING
THAT
GAME
FUCKING
BRUTAL
IF
I
WASNT
AT
MY
GRANDFATHERS
VISITING
HIM
TO
WATCH
THE
GAME
I
WOULDVE
BEEN
SCREAMING
SWEAR
WORDS
I
SAID
ENOUGH
TO
COVER
YOU
DONT
WORRY
BUDDY
I
SWEAR
BROTHERS
JUST
WAS
STARING
AT
LEBRONS
ASS
THAT
PLAY
MISSED
A
TRAVEL
AND
A
FOUL
HYPNOTIZED
BY
LEBOOTY
GOTTA
SAY
IT
WAS
MORE
SHITTIER
FOR
THE
CAVS
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
THEIR
BAD
CALLS
OCCURRED
IN
SOME
EXTREMELY
CRUCIAL
SITUATIONS
THIS
WAS
A
RIDICULOUS
GAME
THE
CAVS
SHOULD
HAVE
CLOSED
OUT
THE
GAME
EASILY
IN
REGULAR
TIME
LEBRON
HAD
A
MASSIVE
GAME
BUT
WASNT
EFFICIENT
DOWN
THE
STRETCH
THE
REFS
WERE
ATROCIOUS
ON
BOTH
SIDES
BUT
MORE
VISIBLY
WITH
SO
MANY
MISSED
FOUL
CALLS
THE
BASKETBALL
GODS
WILL
SPARE
US
BECAUSE
THE
CAVS
DESERVED
THE
WIN
BUT
LETS
HOPE
THE
REST
OF
THIS
SERIES
ISNT
AS
CONTROVERSIAL
ALSO
DELLY
IS
MY
NEW
FAVORITE
PLAYER
HUGE
HUGE
PRAISE
FOR
OUTBACK
JESUS
HE
MADE
THE
MVP
LOOK
LOST
TOOK
ALL
OF
HIS
AIRSPACE
AWAY
WENT
OVER
SCREENS
AND
FOUGHT
THREW
THEM
HARD
HIT
SOME
SHOTS
HUSTLED
FOR
EVERYTHING
WHILE
EVERYONE
WAS
STANDING
HE
CRASHED
AND
GRABBED
THAT
ALL
IMPORTANT
O
BOARD
AND
HIT
THE
CLUTCH
FTS
THEN
FORCES
A
CURRY
AIRBALL
NEXT
POSSESSION
CAME
INTO
STARTING
LINEUP
AND
DID
HIS
PART
REALLY
HAPPY
AND
PROUD
WITH
HIS
EFFORT
AND
HEART
MVP
OF
THE
GAME
LEBRON
WITH
ANOTHER
GOOD
GAME
ALTHOUGH
NOT
THE
MOST
EFFICIENT
OFFENSIVELY
HE
GOT
EVERYONE
INVOLVED
ALL
WHILE
GETTING
HIS
OWN
SHOTS
IN
PLEASE
STOP
FADING
AWAY
ON
YOUR
SHOT
THAT
DEEP
SHOT
HE
MADE
LATE
IN
4TH
SHOWS
HOW
MUCH
BETTER
HIS
SHOT
IS
WHEN
HE
SWAYS
CORRECTLY
INSTEAD
OF
JUST
FLINGING
HIMSELF
BACK
I
GET
THEY
WANT
BRON
TO
HIT
THE
LAST
SHOTS
BUT
AT
LEAST
GIVE
HIM
AN
OPENING
SET
A
SCREEN
CREATE
A
POSSIBLE
MISMATCH
DONT
JUST
DUMP
IT
HIGH
IN
THE
WING
FOR
A
CHUCK
UP
3
JR
WITH
SOME
HORRIBLE
PLAYS
DOWN
THE
STRETCH
CMON
MAN
KLAY
THOMPSON
WAS
ON
FIRE
EARLY
IN
THE
GAME
QUESTIONABLE
FOULS
TOOK
HIM
OUT
EARLY
REALLY
GOOD
JOB
STEPPING
UP
WHEN
YOUR
MAIN
STAR
IS
STRUGGLING
DRAY
MIND
WITH
A
HUGE
DEFENSIVE
IMPACT
THAT
BLOCK
ON
BRON
WOW
CLEAN
AF
OVERALL
MUCH
MUCH
BETTER
EFFORT
BY
CAVS
AND
WAY
BETTER
BALL
MOVEMENT
THIS
GAME
STILL
SOME
STANDING
ISO
FOR
LEBRON
BUT
AT
LEAST
THERE
WAS
MOVING
PLAYERS
MOST
TIMES
BUT
THAT
WAS
A
BIG
MENTAL
COLLAPSE
END
OF
4TH
RESORTED
TO
MORE
ISO
AGAIN
MOVE
THE
BALL
DOESNT
NEED
TO
BE
A
LEBRON
DEEP
SHOT
GET
A
SHOOTER
OPEN
THERE
WERE
SOME
WEIRD
CALLS
I
REALLY
DIDNT
LIKE
ESPECIALLY
TOWARDS
THE
END
FOR
BOTH
SIDES
AND
MOST
IMPORTANTLY
I
REALLY
AGREE
WITH
JVG
AS
A
DEFENDER
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
JUMP
TO
DEFEND
AND
ITS
NOT
FAIR
IF
YOU
LET
THE
SHOOTER
JUST
JUMP
INTO
YOU
THATS
HORSESHIT
GREAT
GAME
ALTHOUGH
HAMPERED
BY
THE
QUESTIONABLE
CALLS
BUT
WHATEVER
THIS
IS
A
HELL
OF
A
SERIES
TBH
I
THOUGHT
THE
CAVS
WERE
COMPLETELY
DONE
BUT
NOW
I
FEEL
LIKE
WARRIORS
WILL
HAVE
TO
PLAY
REALLY
HARD
TO
WIN
GOD
DAMN
FOOL
YOU
WROTE
A
NOVEL
WHILE
THE
GAME
WAS
STILL
BEING
PLAYED
I
DONT
THINK
IVE
EVER
SEEN
SOMEONE
PRETYPE

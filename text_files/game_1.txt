iman shumpert half an inch away from glory i dont know how you sleep again after a shot like that for me its bad enough that you miss that and fail to close out but to add that your miss led to an overtime where kyrie may have gotten injured probably makes it worse  it wasnt even just that it hit the rim a bit more backspin a few more revolutions and not only is that game but kyrie doesnt get injured is nobody going to acknowledge just how good andre iguodala was tonight my god he was an all star in philly for a reason this should be higher taking the job of guarding lebron and also picking up the offense to help offset a lackluster performance from klay great game from iggy this is honestly the role he should have had for his entire career so happy to see him having such success only way the cavs win this series is if lebron evolves into mega lebron 2 headbands httpterezowenscomuploadss3amazonawscom201204lebronmainjpg wasnt this mega lebron tonight or was that only super lebron he has to evolve into super mega lebron if lebron dropping over 40 isnt enoughthats bad news for cleveland it was a 40 point game but his passes have to turn into assists as well obviously not entirely under his control i dont see much better coming out of lebron and kyrie bron had 44 8 6 kyrie 23 7 6 4 holy shit kyrie thats ridiculous the bench needs to step up especially if kyrie is down i thought mozgov played exceptionally well and tt was gobbling up the rebounds its just those 2 arent gonna win you basketball games they will only help and lebron alone can only possibly do so much im calling gsw in 5 a higher likelihood of 6 games than 4 but no way it goes to 7 theres as reason why he wasnt getting heaps and heaps of assists this was gss gameplan let lebron score 40 or 50 and just close out everyone else theres a reason they rarely double teamed lebron until when he was already shooting its because they know how good he is at passing atlanta tried to just double lebron and got wrecked because he is amazing at passing out of a double credit to the warriors coaching staff for making the right call they just let him score and let everyone else get cold lebron is reacting to lebronite aka game 6 in boston lebron live by the smith die by the smith i know the feeling iguodala is a spectacular defender what a player to have off the bench for real his experience guarding superstar players lets the rest of the warriors not need to double on his matchup with lebron it was incredible how he forced lebron to settle for jumpers so many times i mean he made them but still you can only defend so much hes honestly a starter the genius of steve kerr was letting him lead the bench it was all about bringing balance to the starting lineup and bench like the spurs bringing manu off the bench except iguodala is like the defensive manu if dlee hadnt gotten hurt and was still starting it might not have stayed that way but draymond filled in for iggys defense and it just went from there i havent seen a black man with so little help since hurricane katrina shut it down lets go home damn steve kerr doesnt care about cavs people mike miller stares intensely lebron james doesnt care about blatts people jesus christ bruh cleveland is gonna have nightmares over this one they wasted a monstrous game by lebron lebron scored all them points but he was awful for the last 2 mins of the 4th and ot 2011 4th quarter lebron  2007 cavs  this 2011  4  2015 wake up sheeple the jews control israel israel controls blatt lebron controls blatt so lebron  israel jews control lebron confirmed lebron isos cant beat steel teams memories of the good old days eh lebron what a clusterfuck of an overtime for cleveland regulation was like foreplay leading to a disappointing sex act of an overtime cleveland trying to prove they deserve that 1 misery ranking get well soon kyrie god hates cleveland  atl hates dellavedova as does chicago status of my anus throughout the game quarters

injury ouch golden state defeat lebron kyrie and mozgov in extra time and take a 10 lead dont forget tristan thompson every time the warriors got a rebound it felt like a fluke this series between the 2015 golden st warriors vs the 2009 cleveland cavaliers should be entertaining bruhhttpwwwthreadbombingcomdatamedia311237283238173jpg no shump was not on that 09 team theres the jr smith we know and love loved the shot that hit the side of the backboard you know cavs started losing when they stopped doing lebron iso lebron iso in the post he was jacking up shots at the end that were not helping he ran out of gas he only had energy left to throw up outside shots they relied on him too much earlier in the game you know hes out of gas when currys guarding him and he decides to shoot a pullup three this this this a thousand times this you dont beat lebron you let lebron beat lebron this it was clear as day that kerr was going to let lebron gas himself out gotta give some credit to iguadola he played exceptional d kyrie was a beast tonight his first finals game was on its track to be hella memorable before he went down edit people are probably going to remember his injury instead of his performance in the future if kyrie ends up being out for a game or two i cant believe that happened what an awful season for injuries i couldnt believe it until i looked at the boxscore and saw that the played 44 minutes dude said he was going to will himself to play then played more minutes than stephen curry shows the depth of the cavs bench deleted and blocked him on 2 plays where curry seemingly had him beat yeah that block at the end was awesome if i wasnt a warriors fan id have been off the couch at his recovery was it just me or were people falling down left and right this game i seem to remember bogut mozgov and maybe green all laying down in the paint together having a cuddle at one point watching kyries frustration walking back to the locker room was heartbreaking i hope hes able to come back strong yeah i had a super hard time watching that just moving with pure frustration i hope he comes back fun as hell game yeah im not very interested in seeing lebron isos all series well youd only have to see it for 3 more games the warriors have faced 4 teams with injured point guards this playoff run kerr seen grinning in the backgroud clutching a monkeys paw look at the landscape of the west though warriors and mavs were the only teams w fully healthy pgs edit switched clips w mavs  and lets be real here  how much should rondo count not sure if rondos back injury counts though not sure if rondo counts period fuck rondo warriors have also faced 4 teams each with a healthy nba 1st allteam player anthony davis marc gasol james harden and lebron james cleveland scored 2 points in overtime what its important to note that those two points were gimmies haha on an unguarded layup no headband included lebron just said theres no fucking way we getting shut out he should have just said fuck it and thrown down a 360 dunk has lebron given up sportscenter but imagine if he blew it everyone would go deaf due to crowd noise lol it was an unguarded layup once it was already completely decided lebrons cavs essentially scored 0 in ot bad jr smith happened knicks jr showed up i would say it was more that lebron went 09 before that layup edit apparently the cavs as a team were 09 not just lebron deleted 2 of those in garbage time deal wit ithttpiimgurcombnlmzfsgifv i dont blame lebron in ot though he carried the team otherwise and the warriors defense stepped up god anyone who blames lebron shouldnt be allowed to watch the rest of the finals no love no kyrie in ot terrible jr and shump was largely average but yeah lets blame the dude who fucking carried the team to ot props to thompson tho monster on the boards mozgov had a pretty solid game those last 2 points were pity points lol it was basically a shutout quarter and those two points happened with 8 seconds left so thats pretty clutch den right damn that ot was ugly dejected lebron leaving the court immediately at the buzzer but doesnt leave anyone hanging as he walks to the locker room even a little kid that came out of nowhere respect noticed that too i know for sure if that shit just happened to me i woulda walked right past that kid i would have throat kicked that fucker imagine being a kid about to see your idol who happens to be 68 250lbs and just getting destroyed by him because he had a bad day how far do you think hed launch him with a kick im thinking a good 7 feet save it for the offseason this will be a good thread in july remindme 2 months make thread about how far lebron james could kick a child lebron no killer instinct confirmed mj would have punched that little fucker in the face s kill me please hope hes alright  to maybe lose a title like this fucking blows injuries to 23 of your best players a fucking shame i feel so bad for kyrie  not yet my son you need more time to suffer god i mean we still have johnny football with the browns  weeping irving didnt bust his ass all season just to watch jr smith start jerking off midcourt during the finals did lebron brick the game winner to injure kyrie  tune into sportscenter where we have inside information from a close friend who reveals lebron james alter ego jabronie jaimes wants to singlehandedly take the series cavs bench scores zero points after 1st half only 9 total all jr couldnt have asked more from lebron or other starters jr smith was as cold as one can humanely get so most likely hell go off for 30 in game 2 and be lauded as a hero as a knicks fan i assure you that jr smith can get a lot colder few things  this games been a long time coming did not disappoint  lebrons post ups are as reliable as his new hair transplants  lebron is going to be on all the headlines tomorrow but irving was unbelievable tonight hope he can shake off the injury  jr smith played like the way rnba thinks josh smith plays tonight  the thing that won this game for me steve kerr going small in ot ballsy and genius jr made some really bad plays late in the game i dont think he scored at all after the first half all will know the true jr before this series is over every year some people have this shortsighted revelation that he is a changed player every year those people are wrong jrs playing style keeps both teams in the game gt lebrons post ups are as reliable as his new hair transplants  thats good right i honestly dont know well his post up game was  so im gonna guess it was complimenting his hair transplants this may be controversial but lebron still should have shaved his hair transplants are too patchy you can still see where hes balding man theyre basically showing kyrie holding back the tears in the locker room this is sad stuff this will probably be a good series but the warriors bench is going to win it its crazy how they can just keep throwing effective players at other teams its ridiculous they have five dudes who would be the designated stopper on a lot of teams  iguodala green klay livingston and arguably barnes cant keep up with that ezili  5 pts 5 reb in 12 minutes speights  8 pts 3 reb in 9 minutes livingston  4 pts 5 rebs 3 asts in 16 minutes barbosa  2 pts 3 rebs in 9 minutes iggy  15 pts 3 reb 2 asts in 32 minutes warriors minute management is a big reason they can win this series all five guys off the bench contributed at key points in the game meanwhile jr scored all 9 of the bench points for cleveland oh and the other two guys coming in dellavadova and james jones ouch this finals mvp race between iggy and marreese speights will be exciting this will be a sweep if kyrie is out lebron um will find a way going small in overtime against lebron and mozgov was such a ballsy play by kerr not 3 not 4 not 5 not 6 not 7 but 2 points in overtime gt 2 points in overtime gt 2 rings in miami illuminati confirmed miami has five letters five letters minus two points equals threeisnt there a game that needs a third installment or something mario kart triple dash confirmed savage fucker you are that was merciless httpiimgurcom6pcgbpmgif they were a shitty 2 points he fully did that to avoid having 0 points in overtime people are going to hate on klays shooting but seriously 21 points 88 from the line 6 rebounds 2 steals and some stellar defense fg be damned that is a pretty damn good game for his first ever finals appearance huge bomb 3 late in the 4th too cavs absolutely blew there chance to steal game 1 kyrie makes an incredible block to get them the ball score tied with 24 seconds left and lebron takes a fadeaway from 20 feet out youre the underdog on the road playing the best team in the league if you have a chance to win it at the buzzer in regulation dont take a fucking long 2 and just hope you can handle them in ot and then in ot you dont run a single play just hope an exhausted lebron can keep pace for you against the best defense in the league cavs were gonna need a lot of luck to win this series and they just absolutely blew an opportunity to steal a game on the road im not even a cavs fan but just what the fuck its almost like lebron is so used to being on the big stage that he doesnt know when to show urgency i dont want to say this was a must win cuz its just game 1 but you just cant let an opportunity like this slip through your hands i dont even know the right words to describe how good of an opportunity this was for the cavs honestly lebron backing down was working the whole freaking game when he took that fade away long two i was beside myself its because of thishttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyi1glbbyeq i was freaking out not the spot not the spot i dont get why he didnt drive he took the worst possible shot there was even if the step back had worked itd still be an unbalanced fadeaway from 20 feet he was getting all he wanted all game what the hell happened to the cavs in overtime obviously losing kyrie is a huge blow but even before he went down they were scoreless for like 35 minutes were they just fatigued kyries handles so good he broke his own anklesimsorry my god that defense by the warriors in the final minute of the 4th and all of ot that was some of the best teamdefense ive ever seen edit really hope kyrie is good to go for the rest of the series this game was fucking phenomenal all game just wouldnt be the same without him the cavs really need some better plays to run than a lebron iso people acting like a lebron iso isnt a top5 play league wide and that it wasnt the shot that the warriors had decided to give up all game they defended him as best they could but they pretty much forced cleveland and lebron to become 1 dimensional not much anyone could do igoudala was a huge part of lebron struggling at the end there he played exceptional defense andre was game mvp imo his defense on lebron was amazing warriors fan here the cavs gave the warriors a really hard time tonight and gs was lucky to sneak away with game 1 it was a really entertaining game until overtime i hope kyrie can shake it off and come back and play well like tonight so that whenif the warriors win the championship it will be earned against a quality cavs team otherwise there will be rumblings that every team the warriors played on route to a championship was against opponents hobbled by injuries well the warriors defended lebron the way that the spurs have shown works put a good defender iggy on him and force him to shoot or driveback down make him tired dont let him pass to open 3 point shooters stay on your men it showed in the second half when jr barely touched the ball because of this and then when he did get his shots he was way off from not shooting in so long felt like all i witnessed with lebron isos the entire game cant lie he was a beast he had several offensive foul elbows in there but he was a monster the whole game until ot but honestly there has to be more from everyone else if they want to win if this is the game plan for the cavs theyre going to get swept gsw defense finally showed up in ot best defense ive seen from any team in the playoffs this year for once i felt like igoudala earned his money big shots big plays big boy defense thats the igoudala i watched in philly been looking for him since the 2012 olympics i loved how gsw stayed focused even with lebron basically getting whatever he wanted great game cant wait for an entire series of thompson clay that is edit klay can kaylay be a nickname klay at one point breen says thompson on thompson thompson cant handle the pass thompson picks up the ball lol good win for gsw few things i noticed bogut made mozgod look like shaq out here he needs to play better luckily they have other centers kyrie irving is really fucking good more importantly you could see how much he wanted it you could argue he looked hungry than lebron lebron was freaky good but it looked like he took a few plays off ive never seen someone play has hard on both ends as kyrie tonight fingers crossed for him as soon as this went to overtime i knew the warriors won the cavs isoed for 48 minutes and it wore them out they also never really found a rhythm this is going to be a good series bogut gave up a lot of room shading towards lebronkyrie which allowed mozgov easy real estate to get in close under the rim cant really do anything about that i think the warriors live with mozgov grabbing the occasional lob 4337 minutes for kyrie thats just poor minutes management for a guy who has so many injuries i agree but on the one hand they needed every one of those seconds out of kyrie to win this game if they wanted to win the series they gambled and lost watching this game with warriors homers is exhausting how you gonna criticize lebron for this loss no sensible person can criticize him beast of a series this is going to be i hope kyrie is ok lebron went off but i think cleveland relied on iso too much in the end id like to see more movement to get lebron better looks iguodala was the xfactor in this game for me made big plays hit a couple big 3s and had a couple big defensive plays late interesting stat all players on gsw that played managed to get at least one point one rebound and one assist as a casual observer with no vested interest in either team from what i saw today golden state is a much deeper and more versatile team than cleveland if the games and the series go the distance golden state is winning this series saw it in the overtime this game cleveland was spent cant win a series hoping that jr smith and shumpert contribute wow what a game one fucking lebron man every time he touched the ball i was scared and shumps missing that buzzer beater by a bees dick fucking insane hope kyrie is healthy for game 2 sweet d in ot dubs

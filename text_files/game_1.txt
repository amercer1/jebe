HE
WAS

THIS

IT

HOW
HE

SO

I

HE
MADE

BUT
STILL
YOU

TAKES
A
FADEAWAY
FROM

OUT
YOURE
THE
UNDERDOG
ON
THE
ROAD
PLAYING
THE
BEST
TEAM
IN
THE
LEAGUE
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
WIN
IT
AT
THE
BUZZER
IN
REGULATION
DONT
TAKE
A
FUCKING
LONG
2
AND
JUST
HOPE
YOU
CAN
HANDLE
THEM
IN
OT
AND
THEN
IN
OT
YOU
DONT
RUN
A
SINGLE
PLAY
JUST
HOPE
AN
EXHAUSTED
LEBRON
CAN
KEEP
PACE
FOR
YOU
AGAINST
THE
BEST
DEFENSE
IN
THE
LEAGUE
CAVS
WERE
GONNA
NEED
A
LOT
OF
LUCK
TO
WIN
THIS
SERIES
AND
THEY
JUST
ABSOLUTELY
BLEW
AN
OPPORTUNITY
TO
STEAL
A
GAME
ON
THE
ROAD
IM
NOT
EVEN
A
CAVS
FAN
BUT
JUST
WHAT
THE
FUCK
ITS
ALMOST
LIKE
LEBRON
IS
SO
USED
TO
BEING
ON
THE
BIG
STAGE
THAT
HE
DOESNT
KNOW
WHEN
TO
SHOW
URGENCY
I
DONT
WANT
TO
SAY
THIS
WAS
A
MUST
WIN
CUZ
ITS
JUST
GAME
1
BUT
YOU
JUST
CANT
LET
AN
OPPORTUNITY
LIKE
THIS
SLIP
THROUGH
YOUR
HANDS
I
DONT
EVEN
KNOW
THE
RIGHT
WORDS
TO
DESCRIBE
HOW
GOOD
OF
AN
OPPORTUNITY
THIS
WAS
FOR
THE
CAVS
HONESTLY
LEBRON
BACKING
DOWN
WAS
WORKING
THE
WHOLE
FREAKING
GAME
WHEN
HE
TOOK
THAT
FADE
AWAY
LONG
TWO
I
WAS
BESIDE
MYSELF
ITS
BECAUSE
OF
THISHTTPSWWWYOUTUBECOMWATCHVYI1GLBBYEQ
I
WAS
FREAKING
OUT
NOT
THE
SPOT
NOT
THE
SPOT
I
DONT
GET
WHY
HE
DIDNT
DRIVE
HE
TOOK
THE
WORST
POSSIBLE
SHOT
THERE
WAS
EVEN
IF
THE
STEP
BACK
HAD
WORKED
ITD
STILL
BE
AN
UNBALANCED
FADEAWAY
FROM
20
FEET
HE
WAS
GETTING
ALL
HE
WANTED
ALL
GAME
WHAT
THE
HELL
HAPPENED
TO
THE
CAVS
IN
OVERTIME
OBVIOUSLY
LOSING
KYRIE
IS
A
HUGE
BLOW
BUT
EVEN
BEFORE
HE
WENT
DOWN
THEY
WERE
SCORELESS
FOR
LIKE
35
MINUTES
WERE
THEY
JUST
FATIGUED
KYRIES
HANDLES
SO
GOOD
HE
BROKE
HIS
OWN
ANKLESIMSORRY
MY
GOD
THAT
DEFENSE
BY
THE
WARRIORS
IN
THE
FINAL
MINUTE
OF
THE
4TH
AND
ALL
OF
OT
THAT
WAS
SOME
OF
THE
BEST
TEAMDEFENSE
IVE
EVER
SEEN
EDIT
REALLY
HOPE
KYRIE
IS
GOOD
TO
GO
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
SERIES
THIS
GAME
WAS
FUCKING
PHENOMENAL
ALL
GAME
JUST
WOULDNT
BE
THE
SAME
WITHOUT
HIM
THE
CAVS
REALLY
NEED
SOME
BETTER
PLAYS
TO
RUN
THAN
A
LEBRON
ISO
PEOPLE
ACTING
LIKE
A
LEBRON
ISO
ISNT
A
TOP5
PLAY
LEAGUE
WIDE
AND
THAT
IT
WASNT
THE
SHOT
THAT
THE
WARRIORS
HAD
DECIDED
TO
GIVE
UP
ALL
GAME
THEY
DEFENDED
HIM
AS
BEST
THEY
COULD
BUT
THEY
PRETTY
MUCH
FORCED
CLEVELAND
AND
LEBRON
TO
BECOME
1
DIMENSIONAL
NOT
MUCH
ANYONE
COULD
DO
IGOUDALA
WAS
A
HUGE
PART
OF
LEBRON
STRUGGLING
AT
THE
END
THERE
HE
PLAYED
EXCEPTIONAL
DEFENSE
ANDRE
WAS
GAME
MVP
IMO
HIS
DEFENSE
ON
LEBRON
WAS
AMAZING
WARRIORS
FAN
HERE
THE
CAVS
GAVE
THE
WARRIORS
A
REALLY
HARD
TIME
TONIGHT
AND
GS
WAS
LUCKY
TO
SNEAK
AWAY
WITH
GAME
1
IT
WAS
A
REALLY
ENTERTAINING
GAME
UNTIL
OVERTIME
I
HOPE
KYRIE
CAN
SHAKE
IT
OFF
AND
COME
BACK
AND
PLAY
WELL
LIKE
TONIGHT
SO
THAT
WHENIF
THE
WARRIORS
WIN
THE
CHAMPIONSHIP
IT
WILL
BE
EARNED
AGAINST
A
QUALITY
CAVS
TEAM
OTHERWISE
THERE
WILL
BE
RUMBLINGS
THAT
EVERY
TEAM
THE
WARRIORS
PLAYED
ON
ROUTE
TO
A
CHAMPIONSHIP
WAS
AGAINST
OPPONENTS
HOBBLED
BY
INJURIES
WELL
THE
WARRIORS
DEFENDED
LEBRON
THE
WAY
THAT
THE
SPURS
HAVE
SHOWN
WORKS
PUT
A
GOOD
DEFENDER
IGGY
ON
HIM
AND
FORCE
HIM
TO
SHOOT
OR
DRIVEBACK
DOWN
MAKE
HIM
TIRED
DONT
LET
HIM
PASS
TO
OPEN
3
POINT
SHOOTERS
STAY
ON
YOUR
MEN
IT
SHOWED
IN
THE
SECOND
HALF
WHEN
JR
BARELY
TOUCHED
THE
BALL
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
AND
THEN
WHEN
HE
DID
GET
HIS
SHOTS
HE
WAS
WAY
OFF
FROM
NOT
SHOOTING
IN
SO
LONG
FELT
LIKE
ALL
I
WITNESSED
WITH
LEBRON
ISOS
THE
ENTIRE
GAME
CANT
LIE
HE
WAS
A
BEAST
HE
HAD
SEVERAL
OFFENSIVE
FOUL
ELBOWS
IN
THERE
BUT
HE
WAS
A
MONSTER
THE
WHOLE
GAME
UNTIL
OT
BUT
HONESTLY
THERE
HAS
TO
BE
MORE
FROM
EVERYONE
ELSE
IF
THEY
WANT
TO
WIN
IF
THIS
IS
THE
GAME
PLAN
FOR
THE
CAVS
THEYRE
GOING
TO
GET
SWEPT
GSW
DEFENSE
FINALLY
SHOWED
UP
IN
OT
BEST
DEFENSE
IVE
SEEN
FROM
ANY
TEAM
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
THIS
YEAR
FOR
ONCE
I
FELT
LIKE
IGOUDALA
EARNED
HIS
MONEY
BIG
SHOTS
BIG
PLAYS
BIG
BOY
DEFENSE
THATS
THE
IGOUDALA
I
WATCHED
IN
PHILLY
BEEN
LOOKING
FOR
HIM
SINCE
THE
2012
OLYMPICS
I
LOVED
HOW
GSW
STAYED
FOCUSED
EVEN
WITH
LEBRON
BASICALLY
GETTING
WHATEVER
HE
WANTED
GREAT
GAME
CANT
WAIT
FOR
AN
ENTIRE
SERIES
OF
THOMPSON
CLAY
THAT
IS
EDIT
KLAY
CAN
KAYLAY
BE
A
NICKNAME
KLAY
AT
ONE
POINT
BREEN
SAYS
THOMPSON
ON
THOMPSON
THOMPSON
CANT
HANDLE
THE
PASS
THOMPSON
PICKS
UP
THE
BALL
LOL
GOOD
WIN
FOR
GSW
FEW
THINGS
I
NOTICED
BOGUT
MADE
MOZGOD
LOOK
LIKE
SHAQ
OUT
HERE
HE
NEEDS
TO
PLAY
BETTER
LUCKILY
THEY
HAVE
OTHER
CENTERS
KYRIE
IRVING
IS
REALLY
FUCKING
GOOD
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
YOU
COULD
SEE
HOW
MUCH
HE
WANTED
IT
YOU
COULD
ARGUE
HE
LOOKED
HUNGRY
THAN
LEBRON
LEBRON
WAS
FREAKY
GOOD
BUT
IT
LOOKED
LIKE
HE
TOOK
A
FEW
PLAYS
OFF
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
SOMEONE
PLAY
HAS
HARD
ON
BOTH
ENDS
AS
KYRIE
TONIGHT
FINGERS
CROSSED
FOR
HIM
AS
SOON
AS
THIS
WENT
TO
OVERTIME
I
KNEW
THE
WARRIORS
WON
THE
CAVS
ISOED
FOR
48
MINUTES
AND
IT
WORE
THEM
OUT
THEY
ALSO
NEVER
REALLY
FOUND
A
RHYTHM
THIS
IS
GOING
TO
BE
A
GOOD
SERIES
BOGUT
GAVE
UP
A
LOT
OF
ROOM
SHADING
TOWARDS
LEBRONKYRIE
WHICH
ALLOWED
MOZGOV
EASY
REAL
ESTATE
TO
GET
IN
CLOSE
UNDER
THE
RIM
CANT
REALLY
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THAT
I
THINK
THE
WARRIORS
LIVE
WITH
MOZGOV
GRABBING
THE
OCCASIONAL
LOB
4337
MINUTES
FOR
KYRIE
THATS
JUST
POOR
MINUTES
MANAGEMENT
FOR
A
GUY
WHO
HAS
SO
MANY
INJURIES
I
AGREE
BUT
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
THEY
NEEDED
EVERY
ONE
OF
THOSE
SECONDS
OUT
OF
KYRIE
TO
WIN
THIS
GAME
IF
THEY
WANTED
TO
WIN
THE
SERIES
THEY
GAMBLED
AND
LOST
WATCHING
THIS
GAME
WITH
WARRIORS
HOMERS
IS
EXHAUSTING
HOW
YOU
GONNA
CRITICIZE
LEBRON
FOR
THIS
LOSS
NO
SENSIBLE
PERSON
CAN
CRITICIZE
HIM
BEAST
OF
A
SERIES
THIS
IS
GOING
TO
BE
I
HOPE
KYRIE
IS
OK
LEBRON
WENT
OFF
BUT
I
THINK
CLEVELAND
RELIED
ON
ISO
TOO
MUCH
IN
THE
END
ID
LIKE
TO
SEE
MORE
MOVEMENT
TO
GET
LEBRON
BETTER
LOOKS
IGUODALA
WAS
THE
XFACTOR
IN
THIS
GAME
FOR
ME
MADE
BIG
PLAYS
HIT
A
COUPLE
BIG
3S
AND
HAD
A
COUPLE
BIG
DEFENSIVE
PLAYS
LATE
INTERESTING
STAT
ALL
PLAYERS
ON
GSW
THAT
PLAYED
MANAGED
TO
GET
AT
LEAST
ONE
POINT
ONE
REBOUND
AND
ONE
ASSIST
AS
A
CASUAL
OBSERVER
WITH
NO
VESTED
INTEREST
IN
EITHER
TEAM
FROM
WHAT
I
SAW
TODAY
GOLDEN
STATE
IS
A
MUCH
DEEPER
AND
MORE
VERSATILE
TEAM
THAN
CLEVELAND
IF
THE
GAMES
AND
THE
SERIES
GO
THE
DISTANCE
GOLDEN
STATE
IS
WINNING
THIS
SERIES
SAW
IT
IN
THE
OVERTIME
THIS
GAME
CLEVELAND
WAS
SPENT
CANT
WIN
A
SERIES
HOPING
THAT
JR
SMITH
AND
SHUMPERT
CONTRIBUTE
WOW
WHAT
A
GAME
ONE
FUCKING
LEBRON
MAN
EVERY
TIME
HE
TOUCHED
THE
BALL
I
WAS
SCARED
AND
SHUMPS
MISSING
THAT
BUZZER
BEATER
BY
A

DICK
FUCKING
INSANE
HOPE
KYRIE
IS
HEALTHY

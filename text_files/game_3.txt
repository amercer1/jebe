this dudes series ppg went down by scoring 40 dellavedova just having fun out there being brett favre draymond is shitting the bed on offense and its really causing trouble for golden state edit and when you think about it his main strength of being able to switch onto almost anyone isnt as useful with the way the cavs have been playing theyre just trying to get lebron into a favorable match up and then isoing and barnes 08 0 points urabsho salivating hes right at the absolute wrong fucking time yeah seriously jeff van gundy brought up a good point too the nba needs more people who can work that midrange game green either bricked a 3 or just drove recklessly into mosgov b scott was right all along fuckers checkmate rnbathiests why did i check to see if that was a real thing in this moment i am euphoric not because of mark jackson and his phony god but because of steve kerr and the dawkins videos we watch after practice  andrew bogut nba center and moderator of rnbathiests im sorry to bring this up cuz its not really the time but this is exactly why lma and melo are undervalueddefenses want to give up midrange jumpers until you hit four in a row i value la you hear that i value you la edit sobs gently warriors were saving david lee for this moment all season just wait until the cavaliers unleash kendrick perkins second half of game 7 the minute restrictions come off please no we dont want to face 3 goat players on the cavs saved him for a bit too long unless you mean the rest of the series in which case they showcased him a bit early yep his reluctance to take wide open threes destroyed a few important offensive possessions if im the cavs id leave him open every game hes been awful in the finals this isnt being talked about nearly enough people are complaining about the calls but green is shitting the bed when he had that wide open 3 and drove it straight into mozgov i facepalmed its a shame too hes one of my favorite players top reasons this is insane  best team in nba setting season low two games in a row in multiple stats  mvp of league setting career lows and even playoff record lows  team loses two of its best players and is seemingly doing better because of it  deli meat apparently people are hungry  splash brothers dryer than california also iso ball is crushing the new nba team offense and defense that is lunacy to be fair were talking about lebron iso ball lebron averaging 41 points 12 rebs 83 asts he just dropped 40 and lowered hid avg hes fading as they say new big three lebron james and matthew dellavedovas two huge balls outback jesus is the man warriors have scored less than 60 after the 3rd quarter only twice this year this game and last game httpspbstwimgcommediachgueccwqaa16jljpglarge that last quarter was almost browns give up the winning td while still in the huddle bad edit it was the goahead touchdown and the bengals still won by 10 so it wasnt the only reason the browns lost was this a real thing i dont want to look it up but i wouldnt be surprised i believe it happened two years ago against the bengals aj green scored if i remember right gt was this a real thing gt browns do you even have to ask yes it was a real thing it happened against the bengals back in 2011httpwwwnewsheraldcomgeneralnews20110911bengals27browns17watchdawgsasleepwithvideo however i was wrong since it was a goahead touchdown and the bengals won by 10 points anyways holy fucking shit the cavs are leading the nba finals without their second or third best players win lose or draw i have never seen anything like this lebron learned this shit from ohio state urban fookin meyer did give a speech at halftime of tonights game were okay we got cardellavedova james deleted called it a month ago delly all

likehttpimgurcomofjb1ng too soon  too old holy fuck straight savage httpimgurcomvts5e9p wow applause wow outback jesus christ my name is matthew decimus dellavedova commander of the armies of the north general of the cavalier legion loyal servant to the true king lebron james brother to a murdered point guard teammate to a murdered power forward and i will have my championship in this life or the next the bench player who became a starter the starter who became a star the star who defied the warriors striking story but now the people want to know how the story ends only a famous finals will do and what could be more glorious than to challenge the warriors themselves in the great oracle arena i was undrafted what difference could i possibly make you guys are getting me so amped fuck can you come to my crib and do the pregame shows i would follow lebron into battle   pgkyrie irvingmatthew dellavedova sgiman shumpertjr smithjoe harris sflebron jamesjames jonesmike millershawn marion pfkevin lovetristan thompson canderson varejaotimofey mozgovkendrick perkinsbrendan haywood this team is up 21 in the nba finals the corpse of mike miller was out there rolling on the floor atlst that corpse was able to throw in bound passes unlike shumpert former knicks attempting sabotage jr last night shump w the inbounds pass right to curry on the 3 point line who only missed because he thought he had accidentally taken lsd because theres no way the other team would just pass him the ball in that situation mozgov doesnt want to take the clutch fts tries to dump it off turnover incredible hah yea curry miss on that wide open 3 was painful good psyche out by shumpert to be fair we clearly saw what a player with zero brain activity looked like shumpert is the first zombie nba player did you watch jr at the end of game 2 best jump shooting vegetable in the nba mike miller professional inbounder over a 67 win team with 2 allnba dudes 2 alldefensive dudes and the best bench in the league oh and the mvp gtsf lebron james makes sense super forward remember when the series stated warriors in 4 not even a series lebron wont win without his stars curry is just too good lebrongoat status in this series edit oh yeah and remember the people saying the warriors wouldnt be held under 100 points again ive never been more impressed by him edit and living in ohio being friends with many cavs fans ive watched his career very closely even if you hate him you have to respect what the man is doing in this series well i dont think hes ever been this impressive pistons game 5 and celtics game 6 2015 games 13 these games dont really compare game 6 celtics 45155 with 1926 shooting and game 5 vs the pistons is the greatest single sports performance i have ever seen i dont even need to look up the stats that 4th quarterot was insane he was unstoppable i would definitely say these games are up there averaging 41 points against a 67 win team and without his best two players unbelievable what hes able to do on the court is incredible the way lebron controlled the pace and contributed in every single way was incredible fuck your efficiency incredible they are one shot away from being up 30 half an inch on shumperts heave dellys there no surprise even if verajao was healthy mozgov would be above him in the rotation but the point stands actually if verajao was healthy mozgov wouldnt be on the cavs id imagine they probably wouldnt have went and traded for him as one of the main reasons they did was because they needed a big man in the middle httpimgurcomrrgnxmg dellys great grandkids will never have to buy a beer in cleveland in their lives shit ill buy any aussie who comes to cleveland a damn beer on my way good game by shawn marion zero turnovers better  than all the gsw starters he was outscored by david lee though if they didnt review that call people would freak the fuck out because it was a terrible call yeah when the live commentators are telling viewers it is for sure the wrong call and it seems like the refs are gonna stick with it anyways in the last like 30 seconds of a finals game people have a right to freak out a bit we are all dellajehovahs witnesses who knew that delly was the best aussie point guard on the cavs straya cunt praise outback jesus the messiah from down under the delly lama seriously though bron drops 40 and the mvp of the game is delly lmao its peanut butter delly time i fucking love basketball are you not entertainedhttpiimgurcomiqkmrg8jpg if the cavs win this series it should go down as one of the greatest individual and team performances in nba history the warriors are historically good and to beat them while missing love and kyrie is just ridiculous jordan scored 32292 career points dellavedova held him to 0 cant argue with that now that i think about it i also held jordan to 0 jordan didnt even gets shot off on me sportsnation gonna steal this one from you he already stole it from someone else httpstwittercomdellyfactstatus608009446808240129 it wasnt his to begin with ive never seen jordan and dellavedova in the same room conspiracy 434 points and gold in 4 minutes wat did steven a smith just try to say he was right all along im sorry what about dellavedova this is like when you beat the elite four with one high level pokemon and the ones you make learn all the hm moves then that makes delly that lapras you pick up to take out brunos onixs that your level 80 lebron charizard cant deal with i just came here to say these finals are an absolute joy to watch two teams playing hard love it its been too long since that clippers spurs series delly is officially now lebrons pippen lol cosigned deleted rlelbron gif train httpgfycatcomhastypleasedgoral vidmehttpsvidmetjaf imgurhttpiimgurcomn6xbrhmgifv gfycathttpgfycatcomdifferentglossygartersnake this is the best thing ive ever seen the way kerr looks above his head almost as though he senses lelbron behind him oh my god httpsstreamablecomi9ts i knew exactly what was coming and i still cried i thought that was like poop or something at first an australian who can drive shoot and is able to fight off overwhelming odds thats right mad matt delly road witness him no matter what side youre rooting for we can all agree on 2 things 1 great fucking series 2 horrible fucking officiating someone raise dellavedovas rating in 2k right now it cant be raised high enough pink diamond delly inbound lockdown defender fo sho i just witnessed that from 35000 feet from above the ocean thank you based airplane internet thank you reddit for the streams i love this game keep it up rnba draymond green is going full 2012 harden this series dray green has lost like 1020 million with his performance so far good im so fucking salty about how useless he is on offense honestly if lebron takes this team to a championship it will be one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of sports finals mvphttpiimgurcomqhrybn3jpg is this photoshopped no how did you get this pic already barnes 08 and draymond 210 they need to step it up if the warriors want to have a chance lebron almost with another triple double incredible performance once again delladova incredible defense for most of the game matthew literally superman for loose balls dellavedova how funny would it be if they started playing land down under at the quicken loans arena ubrokenassenglish is one lucky guy today yeah what a fucking letdown after the first half i thought someone showed the thread to curry and he was down to help us out he actually bet in an earlier thread that if curry didnt score 40 he would delete his account then bet again saying 25 in the game thread fuck ubrokenassenglish no hes not he posted a comment saying if curry didnt drop 40 hed delete his account for the naysayers httpiimgurcom6czkvsmpng he was trying to get extra karma i have no reason to make this shit up i had a eulogy waiting for him steph really bailed him out lol hopefully it carries over to the next game will lebron win another championship find out next time on dragonball z i heavily underestimated the cavs i have to admit i didnt think cleveland had it in them to win i thought that theyd given up but theyre giving it their all and putting up a great fight lebron and delly want it so bad they all do most points in first 3 games nba finals history 2015 lebron james 123 1967 rick barry 122 i have never seen a player single handedly take over a game truly the greatest player of our decade and one of the greatest players of all time we are all lucky to witness the greatness of dellavedova lets all take a minute to thank the basketball gods for this amazing finals series  dear lord threezus and outback jesus thanks fam love rnba de nada its amazing thinking how close it is despite clevelands injuries and that theyre up 21 yeah but lebronalledova david lee better get ready he needs and is probably going to get way more minutes i cant believe were one iman shumpert jumpshot from being up 30 if he would have hit that i would have shit my pants saw were with clippers flair then saw the username were indeed we are all cavs tonight provided theyre playing the warriors not just a jumpshot a falling out of bounds caught midair from behind the rim jumpshot from beyong the arc that still touched rim but yeah fucking crazy mate or just an actual play drawn up on that possession these nba finals are going to kill me im going to need a pacemaker soon lol this video httpsinstagramcomp3ufi09jbvitakenbyfunniest_15seconds the biggest improvement lebron has made imo is not something like fundamentals or we but the attitude i remember last year he would just lose hope after some turnovers by teammates missed shots but now he works damn hard doesnt matter what happened he runs up and down the court giving his everything doesnt matter what he learned to be a true leader he needs to win the series just imagine we are one lebron jumper away from the cavs being up 30 and looking for a sweep the cavs have been absolutely insane this series warriors have looked flustered every game and kyrie would be healthy never thought id hear delly chants in an nba final this is it i hereby renounce my lebron james hating ways literally nothing this man cant do on the court as a fan of a team not in the finals a lot of these calls are making it a comedy show httpiimgurcomvdrzqtogif delly is breaking my heart man its like this was basketball rocky the way the crowd was chanting his name how could it have not been matthew goat dellavedova httpiimgurcom1yyrwutjpg im not trying to shit on curry or understate dellys performance but this is why i always laugh when people say things like how steph is a top 5 defensive point guard gt i always laugh when people say things like how steph is a top 5 defensive point guard there cant be people who think this httpwwwredditcomrnbacomments2xhsmcsteph_curry_has_held_his_man_to_208533_39cp0d5s4context3 that is disgusting 10 there is no justice havent you heard that gambling on the passing lanes so that you get 1 or 2 steals a game is equivalent to lockdown defense lmao but tbh i dont think its possible to stop the goat delly will the real steph curry please stand up i was alive when matthew dellevedoa played in the nba  michael jordan wayne gretzsky  im positive that if lebron had replaced melo in game 1 of the regular season the knicks would be up 21 on the warriors in the finals yo abbott you better allow that vote on samesex marriage so i can marry the fuck out of delly you come at the king you best not miss someone nerf lebron please lebron be likehttpmedia2giphycommedia4mhv5aio6si2agiphygif seriously hes been op for like 10 years now its like the devs dont even pay attention im glad someone found himbut it was too

httpiimgurcome1rg0jpg im no cavs fan but 1 i dont see a fucking scottie pippen out there 2 i do see a 67win team as competition 3 i dont see any illegal defense calls even if lebron doesnt win this

THE
BIGGEST
IMPROVEMENT
LEBRON
HAS
MADE
IMO
IS
NOT
SOMETHING
LIKE
FUNDAMENTALS
OR
WE
BUT
THE
ATTITUDE
I
REMEMBER
LAST
YEAR
HE
WOULD
JUST
LOSE
HOPE
AFTER
SOME
TURNOVERS
BY
TEAMMATES
MISSED
SHOTS
BUT
NOW
HE
WORKS
DAMN
HARD
DOESNT
MATTER
WHAT
HAPPENED
HE
RUNS
UP
AND
DOWN
THE
COURT
GIVING
HIS
EVERYTHING
DOESNT
MATTER
WHAT
HE
LEARNED
TO
BE
A
TRUE
LEADER
HE
NEEDS
TO
WIN
THE
SERIES
JUST
IMAGINE
WE
ARE
ONE
LEBRON
JUMPER
AWAY
FROM
THE
CAVS
BEING
UP
30
AND
LOOKING
FOR
A
SWEEP
THE
CAVS
HAVE
BEEN
ABSOLUTELY
INSANE
THIS

HAVE
LOOKED
FLUSTERED
EVERY
